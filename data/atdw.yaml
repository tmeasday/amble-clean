    Three inner city houses in Coventry Street are among the few 19th century prefabricated iron buildings remaining in the world.
     
     
    An audiovisual tour provides a comprehensive account of the importance of these buildings in the history of white settlement in Australia and during the gold rush years in Victoria particularly.
     
     
    Once a month the volunteers at the 19th century Portable Houses guide a walk around Emerald Hill and also provide refreshments in the courtyard of the historic Iron Houses.
     
     
    Visitors with an interest in building, architecture, industrial archaeology as well as social history will find the houses of immense interest.

    There's an unusual attraction on Phillip Island, in Victoria, that is certainly making people's heads turn. All who drive the Phillip Island Road can't help but be mystified by the Giant Purple Tap that seemingly floats in mid air, whilst gushing out thousands of litres of water into an apparently Flooded House.
     
     
    When you enter the building, you will be absolutely amazed by what you can see. Water and chairs go uphill, people fly in mirrors,  and others shrink right before your very eyes.  In Puzzle Island, a world first interactive area you can drive the sky train, fall off a 7.5 metre cliff, get lost on a hospital wheelchair, find hidden treasure or see your friends head on a dinner plate,
     
     
    The maze itself, is one Australia's largest, takes an average of 45 minutes to complete. When you have finished getting lost why not tackle the stimulating 19 hole maxi mini-golf course.  After all the excitement you can browse in Victoria's most unique puzzle and games shop or just relax in the Puzzle Cafe with a bite to eat.   Other facilities provided include electric BBQ's and children's' adventure playgrounds.
     
     
    New to A Maze'N Things this year are two brand new shops.
     
     
    Lolly Lips - Phillip Island's premier ice creamery specialising in low fat gelato which allows you to enjoy the rich taste of real fruit and natural flavours.
     
     
    Cafe Chocolatte - which serves wickedly delicious hot chocolates and coffees, chocolate truffles and desserts.
     
     
    A Maze'N Things is located on the Phillip Island Road, opposite the Koala Conservation Centre, five km before Cowes. It is open seven days a week and can cater for individuals, small or large recreational groups, as well as corporate and educational groups.

    When it comes to diving, experience is crucial to a safe and enjoyable dip, so it's no wonder many divers in Melbourne's southern suburbs choose A B Ocean Divers for their aquatic needs. Established in 1972, the business has for the past past 24 years been owned and operated by Warwick, a keen diver since 1961. 
    
     
    
    AB Ocean Divers offers extensive equipment sales, hire and service, but training divers is at the heart of this East Bentleigh operation. It's the only dive centre in Victoria that has two course directors on staff: Warwick, and his business partner Jane - the only female course director in the state. Together with the other PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) accredited instructors on staff, they teach from pre-entry to instructor level. A B Ocean Divers is a PADI five-star instructor development centre (the highest rating available for training, service and professionalism). 
    
     
    
    Graduates of the many courses available often join the A B Ocean Divers club, which offers discounts and regular meetings - a great opportunity to hook up with dive buddies and find out about new equipment. Members are the first to sign up for the frequent dive trips to Port Phillip Bay organised by Warwick, who skippers the appropriately named Ocean Diver, his purpose-built dive vessel. Dive trips interstate and overseas are also frequently organised, as well as snorkelling sessions during summer. Keen to give divers plenty of experience as well as care for Port Phillip Bay's remarkable underwater ecosystem, A B Ocean Divers also runs clean-up dives throughout the year. 
    
     
    
    From experienced divers looking to upgrade equipment or qualifications, to people walking off the street wondering what's so good about life under water, A B Ocean Divers has the answers.

    Acacia Ridge is set in the beautiful Yarra Valley with outstanding views across rolling hills and distant Blue Mountains - a stunning Fred Williams landscape!
     
     
    The property was planted in 1997. The original plan was to sell fruit to the larger wineries. This is still going on, but because the fruit is of such a high standard, we decided to begin making our own wine. This was done under contract by specialist wine makers, local to the Valley.
     
     
    The grapes are slow ripening, small bunch clones, ensuring intensity of colour and flavour. Irrigation is used to a minimum, to assist us in achieving high quality fruit.
     
     
    Acacia Ridge has won a Gold medal at the Victorian Wine Show for its Pinot Noir and Silver at the Lilydale Wine Show. The Chardonnay has also won a Silver medal at the Lilydale Wine Show.
     
     
    Acacia Ridge is a truly unique experience you can't find in a bottle shop. Great for weddings, family gatherings, work or sporting club Christmas parties etc. Plenty of room for everyone to enjoy the setting.

    Kat, the owner of the Academy of Scuba, first dived on a visit to Queensland when she was 16 - I was addicted from the word go!, she says. Now Kat's living her passion: an instructor for the past six years, she bought Academy of Scuba in 2007. Under her direction, this thriving dive centre in Glen Iris was a finalist among the 1000-strong contenders in the 2008 PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) Awards' most outstanding dive centre Asia Pacific category, and followed this up with the regional award in 2009.
     
     
    Part of the Aquatic Adventures group of dive stores, Academy of Scuba sells and hires a wide range of equipment, with a focus on leading brands Oceanic and Scubapro. The extensive premises also host the theory aspects of the many training courses regularly conducted by the academy's highly qualified instructors. Training is available all the way to instructor level, and in the advanced stream of technical diving, which certifies divers to go well below the 30-metre limit of open-water qualifications. However, the team are equally welcoming and attentive to the needs of absolute beginners, whether that be during training or in the shop.    
    
     
    
    Academy of Scuba is the only dive centre in Victoria able to provide dive medical certification on-site, and as of mid-October also offer accommodation in Rye - making their regular dive trips to the Mornington Peninsula even more attractive. Dive holidays interstate and overseas are also organised throughout the year for club members, many of whom gather for the social night at the store every Thursday. Non-club members are also welcome, as the social aspect of diving is central to Academy of Scuba's success.

Shaun, who bought this Bayswater business from its founders three years ago, was among their many prot\xC3\xA9g\xC3\xA9s. A diver since 1999, and an instructor for the past five years, he continues the tradition of passing on everything a diver needs to know. \n\n \n\n\
    An enthusiast of technical diving, an advanced level of diving that goes well below the 30-metre limit enabled by open-water qualifications, Shaun enjoys exploring wrecks and underwater caves. It's no surprise then that they specialise in sales, hire and service of technical diving equipment, such as closed-circuit rebreathers. \n\n \n\n\
    Shaun says he's happy just to get my head under water, so he dives anywhere, from piers to quarries. He's just as happy training someone at a depth of 100 metres as teaching a school group or children's party in a pool. Adventure Downunder's comprehensive program of courses are carried out with a low student-trainer ratio, focusing on personalised service that emphasises safety, confidence and enjoyment. \n\n \n\n\
    A wide range of equipment is in stock throughout the year, not just in the peak summer season, as well as a variety of informative books. Adventure Down Under is a fully equipped service centre: work is done in-house by Shaun, who is an accredited service technician for most brands. \n\n \n\n\
    There are discounts and rewards for members of the very friendly and egalitarian dive club, which is at the heart of a business Shaun and his loyal customers describe as a family. Divers based in the eastern suburbs are quick to sign up to Adventure Downunder's regular local, interstate and international dive trips, which live up to the store's motto of Taking you to new depths."

    At 59 metres, Agnes Falls are the highest single span falls in Victoria.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Take a short stroll through the Blue Gum forest to a viewing area overlooking the falls
     
    * Watch and listen to birds darting between bushes or feeding within the canopy of the trees within the gorge
     
    * Relax and enjoy a picnic or barbecue under the shade of tall blue gums on the grassy banks of the Agnes River
     
     
    The nearest township is Toora, which has toilets, barbecues, picnic tables, information, a caravan park and other bed and breakfast and motel accommodation.
     
     
    Vegetation  
    Agnes Falls Scenic Reserve protects a small remnant of the forests that once covered the Stzrelecki Ranges. Tall southern blue gums together with blackwood and silver wattles grow within the sheltered gorge and along the banks of the Agnes River.
     
     
    Fauna  
    The canopy of tall eucalypts provides food and nesting areas for a variety of birds including the eastern yellow robin, grey fantail, laughing kookaburra, currawong and crimson rosella and a range of honeyeaters.
     
     
    At night possums and owls emerge from tree hollows to feed amongst the spreading branches of the eucalypts. If you are lucky you may catch a glimpse of a swamp wallaby disappearing into the bush.

    Help look after this reserve by remembering these guidelines:
    
     
    * All native plants and animals in the reserve are protected

    The many linking paths through this garden take you beneath a canopy of the awesome mountain ash trees of the Dandenong Ranges. The garden was part of the historic Burnham Beeches Estate, home of Alfred Nicholas, developer of the Aspro formula. It is known for its extensive water features including waterfalls and an ornamental lake complete with boathouse. 
    
      
    
    Things to do
    
         
    * Walk through shady trees down to the picturesque lake, and picnic by the quaint boathouse
         
    * In spring view the flowering azaleas, cherry trees and viburnum
         
    * Take photos of the colourful foliage in the autumn
         
    * View the colourful birdlife
    
     
     
    Heritage 
    
    Alfred Nicholas purchased this land in 1929 to build his home and then proceeded to buy up surrounding land to add to his estate. Alfred Nicholas and his brother George developed the 'Aspro' painkiller. It was originally a German discovery, the supply of which halted during the first world war. George, a chemist, re-discovered the formula, the Australian Government awarded the patent and the Nicholas fortune grew.
     
     
    Mr Nicholas travelled the streets of Melbourne searching for established trees to be purchased for his property. Unfortunately he passed away before the garden was completed, and soon the property began to decline. Mrs Nicholas stayed on the property until the outbreak of the second world war. After the war the house was handed to their company which converted it for use as a research laboratory. The Nicholas Company decided in 1965 to donate the gardens to the people of Victoria by way of the local shire council. In 1972, the council handed the garden over to the Victorian State Government.

    The Alpine National Park is Victoria's largest and protects our highest mountains and varied alpine environments. It has the greatest range of flora and fauna of any national park in Victoria. With adjoining national parks in NSW and the ACT, it forms an area that protects almost all of Australia's high country. Extensive snowfields are the primary winter attraction, while warmer months bring stunning wildflower displays and bushwalks and four wheel driving. The 655 kilometre Australian Alps Walking Track traverses the Alps from Walhalla to Canberra.
     
     
    Australia's Alps are vitally important as a source of water in our dry continent. Most of the major rivers of south-eastern Australia have their sources there.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
         
    * Scenic 2WD tours along the Great Alpine Road Four-wheel driving. NOTE: Some tracks are closed seasonally to protect the environment
         
    * Walking, from short strolls to the Australian Alps Walking Track. WARNING: Ensure you are prepared for sudden weather changes on any walk.
         
    * Commercial tour operators offer a variety of activities such as horse riding, canoeing, rafting, rock climbing or mountain biking
         
    * Try your luck at fishing
         
    * Cycle along the challenging Great Alpine Road between Bright and Omeo
         
    * In winter go cross-country skiing and snow camping. Downhill skiing is based at adjoining resorts such as Falls Creek and Mount Hotham
         
    * Enjoy varied and beautiful summer wildflowers, and discover a whole range of other plants and animals, all adapted to cope with climatic extremes.
    
     
     
    Accommodation ranges from bush camping to lodges and motels in surrounding towns, and in the adjacent ski resorts of Falls Creek, Mt Hotham, Mt Buller and Dinner Plain.

    Howard Anderson established Anderson Winery in 1993, after notching up 30 years experience in the industry   including 15 years as Winemaker at Seppelt Great Western. In 2005 he was joined by his daughter Christobelle, who had completed a Winemaking degree in Adelaide, and worked for wineries in several regions in France.
     
     
    We are unashamed perfectionists, and take a no compromise approach to everything from the vineyard, to winemaking, to customer service. All our wines are made on site, entirely by Howard and Christobelle. Our 8 hectare vineyard is planted on Rutherglen s traditional Buckshot clay soil, and is non-irrigated which ensures a low yield of intensely flavoured grapes.
     
     
    Traditional, labour intensive methods including hand harvesting, basket pressing and minimal additives are used alongside modern knowledge to ensure maximum wine quality. We specialise in full bodied reds (particularly Shiraz, Durif and Petit verdot) with intense inky colour, full rich mouthfilling fruit, and big soft tannins so that they are approachable when young, but will richly reward those who choose to cellar them.
     
     
    The other house specialty is traditionally made white and red sparkling wines. Like the great vintage wines of Champagne, we cellar all our sparklings on yeast lees in the bottle for several years before disgorgement (removal of the yeast) and release, which gives them an extra dimension of complexity, and a lovely smooth, creamy texture.

    In a postcard setting on the banks of Birch's Creek at Smeaton, Anderson's Mill stands as a powerful reminder of an industry that flourished after the gold rush of the 1850's. Standing today much like it was over 100 years ago, the five-storey bluestone building and its magnificent iron water wheel are still in place. Anderson's Mill is located in Smeaton, north of Creswick, in an area well known for it's fertile volcanic soils and goldmining past.
     
     
    Construction of the flour mill commenced in 1861 and it was operational within six months. The Oat section of the Mill was completed by the following harvest.  Outbuildings such as the stables, grain store and bluestone office were added later as the operation expanded.
     
     
    The water wheel was developed from designs by John Smeaton and the patterns cast locally in Ballarat at Hunt and Opie's Victoria Foundry. Water was collected from Hepburn Lagoon, about five kilometres from the Mill, then released into Birch Creek before being channelled into the water race to turn the wheel.
     
     
    The amount of water required depended on the product being processed. The person operating the release gates at Hepburn Lagoon would be asked to release 'half oats water' or 'full flour water' for the shift's operation.

    Nestled in the morning shadow of Mount Bogong, Annapurna Estate Restaurant and Cellar door sits on the edge of  the neatest most impressive vineyard I ve ever seen, high up in Mount Beauty  as described by Mike Kluczko, Chief Sparkling Wine Maker at Southcorp. 
    
     
    
    Annapurna Estate has a philosophy of hospitality and warmth. The menu is modern Australian with an Asian feel. Chef Will Greene uses the highest quality local produce to produce exquisite dishes to compliment our range of wines. If you book a table with us, it's yours for the day. Sit back, relax, and come away feeling revitalised.
     
     
    The vineyard was established in 1989, and consists of approximately 45 acres of a combination of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Merlot and Pinot Gris. The cool climate and soil conditions have contributed to a high quality fruit with excellent flavours, the majority of which goes into premium sparkling wine. 
    
     
    
    Annapurna Estate is known for its sparkling wines, including one of the few Burgundy-styled sparking pinot noirs made in Australia, along with our refreshingly dry o4 Pinot Chardonnay produced using the labour intensive Methode Classique and our 05 Blanc de Noir, a cheeky white sparkling made from pinot noir grapes. 
    
     
    
    Annapurna Estate provides a beautiful setting for weddings and other special occasions. We can host functions of all types and will tailor the event to suit your requirements.    
    
     
    
    Wine tastings, fine dining, exceptional wine, indulgent desserts, excellent coffee, superb service, magnificent setting. We have it all, come and share it with us.

    Opened eight years ago, Aquatic Adventures in Rowville was the first store in this franchise of four Victorian dive shops. Damian, who bought the store in 2007, heads a team of enthusiastic, skilled young divers. One of them has even written a book about his aquatic passion: Mick co-authored Victoria's Ship Graveyard, which maps and describes the many wrecks off Victoria's coast.
     
     
    Shipwrecks are magnets for divers, and the team at Aquatic Adventures Rowville offer the training required to access them - including technical diving courses, which provide certification beyond standard open-water recreational diving. Already a five-star PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) Instructor Development Centre, in 2006 the store earned the prestigious title of Career Development Centre, one of only four such centres in Australia, and the only one in Victoria. This reflects the team's commitment to not just train divers right up to instructor level, but also to developing their careers in the dive industry. However, they're just as happy taking on absolute beginners and showing them the wonders of life under the sea. 
    
     
    
    Aquatic Adventures also organise day trips for qualified divers to the Mornington Peninsula every Wednesday and weekend, as well as dive travel interstate and overseas several times a year. On Fridays the modern, spacious store is open late so that its dive club members and other customers can drop in to refill their tanks in readiness for the weekend, perhaps organise a dive buddy, and generally talk about their aquatic passion. Dive club members enjoy benefits such as weekly email updates and discounts, which apply across the Aquatic Adventures network of stores. However, pretty much everything a diver needs, including equipment sales, hire, service and repair, is available at the Rowville store, which serves divers across Melbourne's south-east.

    Part of the Aquatic Adventures group of dive stores located in suburbs around Melbourne, the Hallam outlet has operated from new, modern premises since relocated from Narre Warren in mid-2009. Heading the highly qualified team is Corry, a PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) Dive master. Aquatic Adventures Hallam is a PADI five-star dive centre.   
    
     
    
    The store sells and hires an extensive range of gear and equipment by leading brands such as Oceanic, Tusa, Waterproof and scubapro to name a few. Also servicing all major-brand equipment. Aquatic Adventures also offers a wide variety of diver training, from beginners to instructor, as well as PADI speciality courses such as digital underwater photography and deep diving - a valuable qualification for  anyone wanting to dive in the Melbourne region, where many reefs and wrecks are beyond the advanced open-water certification's 30-metre limit. 
    
     
    
    Aquatic Adventures in Hallam has a large, active dive club, which meets every Friday night - the ideal opportunity to fill up the tank for the weekend, buy some new gear or find a dive buddy. Corry and the crew also organise weekly dive trips around Port Phillip Bay, as well as Westernport Bay - it's one of the few Victorian dive centres that takes in the delights of the 'other' bay, including shore and boat dives off Phillip  Island. Interstate and overseas trips are also regularly arranged and, like the local dives, are open to club members and non-members alike. 
    
     
    
    Hallam may not be on the coast but, short of ferrying divers to their destination, Aquatic Adventures can sort out the needs of those based in Melbourne's south-eastern suburbs. And there's ample parking right outside the door, so it's never a drama hauling heavy equipment in and out, or making a flying visit on the way to an underwater adventure.

    Rising above the Mornington Peninsula, Arthurs Seat is the most familiar of all Port Phillip Bay landscape features. It's 314 m summit, reached by road or on foot, gives spectacular views of the bay and Port Phillip Heads. On a clear day the view extends as far as the city skyline, the You Yangs and Mount Macedon.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Take the pleasant one hour circuit to Kings Falls.
         
    * Enjoy a view of the bay and city skyline from the summit.
         
    * Visit the delightful Seawinds Garden which contains several sculptures by William Ricketts.
    
     
     
    Heritage 
    
    Matthew Flinders was the first European to climb Arthurs Seat after his ship entered the heads while making his circumnavigation of Australia in 1802.
     
     
    The first owner of Seawinds was Mr Chapman, a gardener at a nearby homestead. The garden was developed by Sir Thomas and Lady Travers in the 1940s who planned to build a house there. This ambition was never achieved and the area was declared a state park in 1975.
     
     
    Fauna 
    
    The park is a protected habitat for many species of birds and animals including koalas, kangaroos, ringtail and brushtail possums, honeyeaters, lorikeets and eastern rosellas.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    This system prevents polluted water from entering Cardinia Reservoir and affecting the quality of our drinking water.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Have a picnic or barbecue 
     
    * The lake has become a popular venue for boating activities such as sailboarding, canoeing and small sail boats up to 3.3 metres
     
    * A boat launching ramp is located near Henley Picnic Area
     
    * Due to water pollution swimming is not recommended
     
     
    Visitors with disabilities are catered for in Bobs Picnic Area. Ramped paths provide access to the barbecue, picnic areas and toilet facilities. Groups of 50 or more people require a permit from the park office. Permits are available up to six months in advance
     
     
    Looking after the park
     
     
    Help us to look after this park by remembering these guidelines:
    
     
    * Take your rubbish with you
     
    * Dogs and other pets are not permitted in Aura Vale Lake Park
     
    * No fires including barbecues may be lit on days of Total Fire Ban
     
    * Solid fuel or portable wood barbecues are not permitted in the park. Portable gas barbecues are permitted. All native plants and animals are protected. 
     
    * All native plants and animals are protected
     
    * Powerboats are not permitted at Aura Vale Lake
     
    * Leave the park as you find it
     
     
    Precautions 
     
    The water quality in Aura Vale Lake is unsuitable for swimming as the lake is the final detention basin for waste drainage water from developed areas on the southern fringe of the Emerald Ridge. A series of open channels, detention basins and a pumping station intercept the drainage and divert it away from Cardinia Dam and into Aura Vale lake.

    Originally starting under the name Candybell, our nursery is still the only commercial propagator of named varieties of Lapageria, or the Chilean Bellflower.
     
     
    Now known as the Australia Begonia company, we still grow a full range of Lapageria, but now we have added tuberous, cane and rex begonias to our growing list. We are currently the world's only nursery specialising in a full range of beautiful Australian bred Tuberous Begonias.
     
     
    We also grow and propagate the fabled Blue Himalayan Poppy, or Meconopsis. The strain which we have found gives best results in Australia is Meconopsis Lingholm, a hybrid of M. grandis.
     
     
    We are currently preparing a display garden of imported tree peonies. This should be ready to open for display by September 2008.
     
     
    Our plants can be seen and purchased at our Erica Begonia Festival, or from our stand at the ABC Gardening Australia Expo in Melbourne and Sydney or from our stand at the Melbourne International Flower and Garden Show. Also plants can be purchased by mail order.
     
     
    The nursery is located at Erica, north of Moe in Gippsland. The area is in the foothills of Mt Baw Baw, at 450m altitude, and receives approx 50in of yearly rainfall.
     
     
    The nursery is open for visits, but please call ahead and make sure we will be here to meet you!

    The Australian Shakespeare Company was founded in 1987 by Glenn Elston, its Artistic Director and Producer, and pioneered popular outdoor theatre in Australia. It has since played to over a million people throughout the country, performing and touring in metropolitan and regional cities and remote and outback locations, from Melbourne and Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens to Kakadu National Park and Beswick Falls in the Northern Territory. Audiences include families, seniors, tourists, students and young professionals, all of whom experience the magic of outdoor performances with some of Australia's finest professional performers and creative artists.
     
     
    Although best known for performances in parks and gardens, the Australian Shakespeare Company creates extraordinary productions for all locations - indoor and outdoor - creating plays that are not only site specific but can be adapted to the needs and circumstances of particular communities and occasions.
     
     
    This summer we celebrate 20th years of Shakespeare Under The Stars with Glenn Elston's acclaimed production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Do not miss this great performance, set in the idyllic setting of the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne with a young, vibrant and comical cast.
     
     
    And Melbourne's favourite family entertainment The Wind in the Willows continues its well-loved tradition of bringing the animal's home to the gardens for summer. Over the years an audience of tens of thousands have delighted in the simple pleasures of this rollicking production. Pack a picnic, pack the kids and join Rat, Mole, Badger, Otter, Portly and, of course, Mr Toad, as they bring to life Kenneth Grahame's immortal story of life on the riverbank at the beautiful Royal Botanic Gardens.
     
     
    For further information about A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Wind in the Willows, including how to get there, please visit our website.

    Established in 1969 by local pharmacist and winemaking legend, Stuart Anderson, Balgownie Estate was the first boutique vineyard to be planted in the Bendigo district in more than 80 years. 
     
     
    The 70's and 80's are often reminisced over by those that would drive up from Melbourne for their allocation of the big full-flavoured reds, renowned for their exceptional ageing qualities. 
     
     
    From these artisan beginnings, the 'Balgownie' name quickly gained a reputation for it's award winning wines both in Australia and overseas.  Even the Queen, on a stately visit, got to have a wee sample of the 1975 and 1976 Cabernet Sauvignon.
     
     
    Today, Balgownie Estate boasts two vineyards and cellars: Bendigo, with predominantly old vine Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz as well as small parcels of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, and now the cool climate Yarra Valley with the regionally distinctive varietals of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.
     
     
    Both the Bendigo and Yarra Valley Cellar Door outlets provide visitors with access to wines from both regions. Each Cellar Door offers visitors a chance to embrace a holistic wine tourism experience with regionally inspired foods from a 'shared table' style cafe and an informative wine museum that captures the trials and tribulations of two of Australia's great wine regions. Welcome to Balgownie Estate!

    Heritage
     
     
    In 1841, a punt was installed on the Yarra River at the site of the bridge at Banksia Park. It opened the best route between Melbourne and the Bulleen-Templestowe area enabling the earliest Europeans to settle along the rich river flats. Banksia Park was the first part of the Yarra Valley Parklands to be opened to the public in 1978. 
     
    Vegetation
     
     
    Banksia Park has a unique blend of remnant native vegetation and exotic plants. Ancient river red gums are scattered along the Yarra River's banks, along with manna gums, wattles, grasses and shrubs.
     
     
    On the higher terraces are mature pines, oaks, willows and poplars. 
     
    Fauna
     
     
    Over 80 different species of birds have been recorded in the park. A keen eye may spot a superb fairy-wren or a rainbow lorikeet along the river. Pacific black ducks and dusky moorhens are easily seen around the Banksia Park pond. Other inhabitants include possums, gliders, wombats, reptiles, frogs and a variety of fish. 
     
    Looking after the park

    Barmah State Park (7,900 hectares) and Barmah State Forest (21,600 hectares) are on the Murray River flood plain between Echuca and Tocumwal, about 225 kilometres north of Melbourne. Together they make up the largest River Red Gum forest in Victoria. Equally, the area could be called a wetland as much of it is frequently flooded.
     
     
    Things to do 
    
     
    
    The best times to visit are late spring, summer and early autumn.
    
         
    * Visit the Tourist Information Centre in Echuca for information on river tours
         
    * Take the 60 kilometre (two hour) self-drive tour to sites of historical interest in the Forest, including the Muster Yard, Punt Paddock Lagoon, Cornalla Landing and Green Engine
         
    * Follow the walking tracks, varying in length from four to seven km. Walking is most enjoyable on cool, sunny days, but tracks in the forest can be impassable after rain
         
    * See 500-year-old river red gums in Barmah Forest
         
    * Try canoeing or fishing on the Murray River

    Barwon Bluff Marine Sanctuary is located at the mouth of the Barwon River at Barwon Heads, about 20 kilometres to the west of the entrance to Port Phillip Bay. The Marine Sanctuary covers 17 hectares. The intertidal and shallow subtidal sandstone and basalt reefs of the marine sanctuary provide habitat for a diverse range of marine flora and fauna. The water of the reefs supports extensive kelp forests including thick patches of both Giant and Bull Kelp. The wrecks of two ships are located on the outer edges of the reef.
     
     
    Things to Do 
    
     
    
    The marine sanctuary is a popular area for activities including swimming, rock pool rambling and snorkelling. The stands of Giant Kelp at Barwon Bluff provide an inviting swim for snorkellers, and the rock platforms are home to an abundance of life in easily accessed rock-pools.
     
     
    Precautions 
    
     
    
    For your own safety, only undertake activities appropriate to your skills and abilities. Take all necessary precautions, be aware of changing conditions, and watch for potential hazards, such as rips. A number of marine animals are potentially harmful if not treated with respect and care, so ensure that you familiarise yourself with these species. Sunburn and hypothermia are also potentially harmful but easily avoided.

    Barwon Grange is an elegant intact brick home dating from Geelong's earliest residential settlement.
     
     
    It was built in 1855 and reflects the aspirations of middle class businessman Jonathan Porter O'Brien and his family who had emigrated from Liverpool.
     
     
    The picturesque Gothic style architecture includes steep gables, unusual decorative timber bargeboards and verandah parapet.
     
     
    The interior contains a fine collection of early Victorian furniture and fittings faithfully accumulated according to an inventory compiled when the house was auctioned in 1856.
     
     
    The garden complements the house with a Victorian fountain. Lawns sloping down to the Barwon River are planted with species from a mid 19th century plant catalogue. Self-guided garden walks are available.

    Heritage 
    
    Halladale Point is named for the shipwreck of the Falls of Halladale, which ran onto the reef off the point in 1908. But Halladale Point has another name - Massacre Point. Rumour has it that Europeans killed a group of the Kirrae-Wurrong Aborigines here by driving them off the cliff.
     
     
    The story continues that the women and children of the group were then killed in the nearby swamp at Massacre Bay. The Aboriginal population of the area droppped from several hundreds in the 1840s to three or four by the 1880s.
     
     
    Coastal traders and immigrant vessels also feature among the four known wrecks along this stretch of coastline. Of the two coastal traders, the Children, owned by the Henty Family, was wrecked in 1839 with the loss of 17 lives.

    Beleura House Garden   The John Tallis Bequest   a theatre of the past  
     
     
     Beleura is a wonderful time capsule, a theatre of the past, yet it appears that life in the house goes on. Unlike a theatre, Beleura and its contents are real   were ever thus; the world it contains will continue if the world as we know it continues. The future will find the past preserved, and be able to understand a life, even into the 21st Century and beyond. The magic of Beleura is the depth of its provenanced collection of household things   some grand but much ephemeral, trivial, amusing  
     
     
    Beleura, an Italianate villa was erected in 1864 for James Butchard. In 1916, the auction of Beleura attracted Mr & Mrs George Tallis (later Sir George & Lady Tallis), who also purchased most of the surrounding land.
     
     
    Sir George spent his retirement farming, however, he is better known as a theatrical entrepreneur who for many years was the major shareholder and Chairman of Directors of the giant entertainment company, J.C. Williamson Ltd.
     
     
    His wife, formerly an actress, became a doyenne of Melbourne society and charity worker. Sir George died in 1948, when by family agreement Beleura was acquired by his youngest son, John Morton Tallis, gentleman, composer of music - John Tallis bequeathed Beleura, its contents and the Tallis Foundation, to the people of Victoria in 1996.
     
     
    Beleura continues this marvellous theatrical tradition and has an exciting schedule of Events and Landmark Events, and the ever-popular, House & Garden Tours.

    The paved Rainforest Walk at the junction of the Bemm and McKenzie rivers enables visitors to experience a rainforest river valley, its secrets of survival and the creatures it harbours. Swing bridges over the McKenzie River and through the gnarled trees add a different dimension to the rainforest experience.
     
     
    Things to see and do
     
     
    The Rainforest Walk is a perfect opportunity for travellers to stop, break their drive and stretch their legs. The walk is one kilometre long over sealed paths, boardwalks and swing bridges. It takes about 30 - 45 minutes to complete at a relaxed pace. Although the track is sealed, wheelchair access is not recommended due to steps in some sections.
     
     
    Information boards along the walk explain the special plants, animals and processes such as fire and flood that contribute to this environment. The nearest camping facilities are in the townships of Cann River, Orbost and Bemm River.
     
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * All native plants, animals, cultural and historic sites and natural features are protected
     
    * Take your rubbish with you
     
    * Please stay on the tracks and paths provided- young trees and shrubs are trying to grow elsewhere
     
    * Dogs are permitted in the reserve but must be kept on a leash and under control at all times
     
     
    Precautions
     
     
    Remember to check weather conditions before you go as the bridges and boardwalk in the scenic reserve are subject to flooding.

    The Benalla Costume and Pioneer Museum was founded in 1967 and is now accredited through the Museum Accreditation Program (Victoria). It is managed entirely by volunteer members of the Benalla & District Historical Society and is a splendid example of how the skills of an enthusiastic and talented group can produce excellence.
     
     
    Benalla is situated on the main highway and rail link between Melbourne and Sydney. The Museum is centrally located on the bank of Lake Benalla (part of the Broken River) adjacent to the unique Ceramic Mural and across the lake from the Botanical Gardens and the outstanding Regional Art Gallery.
     
     
    The Museum specialises in costume and local history, including much of the Ned Kelly story, and houses the famous and unique blood stained sash he was wearing at the siege in Glenrowan.
     
     
    The costume collection dates from 1770 to the present and is shown in regularly changing semi-permanent exhibitions of dressed models with appropriate accessories.
     
     
    Displays include memorabilia of three of Benalla's famous sons including Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop, Captain Hector Waller and Michael J Savage who went on to become a Prime Minister of New Zealand.
     
     
    The most recent exhibition Styled in Silk Since 1770 is an outstanding display of magnificent silk dresses including the 1770 Sacque dress - not to be missed!

    Bendigo Art Gallery has an extensive and varied collection, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, decorative arts, photography and works on paper.

    The Big Desert is home to a wide variety of birds, reptiles and mammals. It offers visitors an opportunity to experience a landscape which has remained unaffected by human beings and provides a challenge for the experienced hiker.
     
     
    The region is considered to be the best single area in Victoria for reptiles with over fifty species of lizards and snakes recorded. Ninety-three species of birds have been recorded in the park including the extremely rare western whipbird. Mammals found in the area include the silky mouse, western pygmy possum and Mitchell's hopping-mouse.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Walk through a true wilderness
         
    * Birdwatching and nature study are rewarding in an area which is home to a great variety of birds, reptiles and small mammals
    
     
     
    There are no facilities or water are provided in the park however there are some campsites provided nearby at Big Billy Bore, the Springs, Moonlight Tank and Broken Bucket Reserve along the Nhill-Murrayville Road. Bore water is available at Big Billy Bore and Broken Bucket Reserve and there are toilets at Broken Bucket. Supplies may be obtained in Nhill, Yanac or Murrayville.
     
     
    Precautions
    
         
    * You must carry your own water.
         
    * Skill in using map and compass are vital. The Danyo and Wallowa sheets in the NATMAP 1:100 000 series covers the area.
         
    * Temperatures in summer are far too high for safe and comfortable walking.
         
    * Before leaving on an overnight walk, please inform the ranger at Wyperfeld National Park.
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    A small family-owned and operated winery producing a wide range of delicious wines - a frequent comment heard in the cellar door is Oh dear, I like them all; what am I going to do now?  We have been awarded many gold, silver and bronze medals at local shows; we also won the Julian West Memorial Trophy at the 2005 Daylesford Wine Show (awarded to a small winery with the most medals). Our cellar door is cosy and friendly - we are always happy to stop what we are doing and talk to visitors who usually become friends before they leave.

    Heritage
     
     
    The name Birrarrung Park was derived from an Aboriginal word for Yarra River. Stone chips, flakes and an axe head found in the park remind us that the area was part of an Aboriginal pathway. Residential and industrial development did not occur in the river valley, mainly because of the threat of flooding. The predominant land use was small-scale cattle grazing and horse agistment. The park has been developed since 1979 and was opened to the public in 1984. 
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * Take your rubbish home with you
     
    * Light fires only in barbecues provided
     
    * Dogs are permitted in the park, but must be kept on a leash at all times
     
    * All native plants and animals are protected

- :description: "Immerse yourself in Melbourne's Aboriginal heritage at Birrarung Marr, the city's newest parkland. Situated between Federation Square and the sports precinct of Rod Laver Arena and the MCG, the riverside park completes an almost continuous green belt around the city. The name Birrarung Marr is taken from the language of the Wurundjeri people, the original custodians of the land \xE2\x80\x93 birrarung means 'river of mists' and marr is 'side'. Wide open spaces and large sculptured terraces have been designed to host some of Melbourne's best events and festivals and they are also popular spots for a picnic. The park is home to the children's creative workshop Artplay, as well as some excellent permanent art installations. Proximities is a sound installation which lends a unique dimension to the William Barak Bridge. Pedestrians enter a sonic corridor of voice recordings of people from the 53 Commonwealth nations represented in Australia. Central to the work are the voices of the Wurundjeri people. Each person sings a traditional song from his/her background with the voices interwoven to create a continually shifting soundscape. Another arresting work is the Federation Bells - 39 bells programmed to play especially commissioned compositions several times daily."

    Family Fun Centres is mini golf with attitude, its an indoor black light glow-in-the-dark 18 hole mini golf course built around an Australiana theme, with state of the art props, special effects and sound along with a lighting system that are combined together deliver Australia's first and only interactive black light mini golf experience. Michael, Julie and family have come along way from eating Vegemite sandwiches at home and making Yorkshire Puddings, to scrape together the funds to make this experience a reality for everyone that either lives or comes to visit Melbourne.
     
     
    When you look behind the giant murals and the larger than life props you find that Family Fun Centres Black Light Mini Golf is based on old fashioned family fun at an affordable price. Julie says what we have here is a really awesome presentation of an old fashioned theme and we now have families waiting to try out our new business model, in fact we already have a couple of dozen bookings for parties and we don't even open until September. This is proving how popular this family entertainment facility is going to be
     
     
    Michael says that You don't need to call us because you can direct book your special party or function on line and pay your holding deposit, The booking calendar lets you see what is available and what is not available immediately, then with just a few mouse clicks your booked. As well as this we have also implemented a new party/function concept, you can now have a party along with the party loot bags, 3D glasses and glow sticks but without the party/function room, this enables us to keep the cost down. We don't even supply food. Families can eat elsewhere around Docklands precinct if required.

    Black Range State Park (11 700 hectares) and the surrounding area provide for excellent bushwalking. A long walk commences at the Black Range Picnic Area and leads to the top of the Black Range providing excellent views. The walk continues south along the range to Muirfoot Track. More adventurous walkers can choose to continue along Muirfoot Track to a walking track leading to Mount Byron (an elevation of 520 metres) or return to the picnic area.
     
     
    The rugged sandstone cliffs of the Black Range, spring wildflowers and the sense of Aboriginal history complement more active recreational pursuits available within the areas adjacent to the park.
     
     
    Rocklands Reservoir, which abuts the Park to the south-east, offers camping, a range of water based activities including boating and fishing, with Redfin predominating.

    This winery was named after an American sailor who jumped ship during the Gold Rush of the 1850s and made his way to this part of the world. So much for the history lesson. The wines are much more interesting, anyway. Shiraz is ripe, sweet and jammy, but has lifted liquorice and bacony, tarry flavours and odours, too. And it will get better in the bottle. The Cabernet Sauvignon is intense and quite fine, with a core of very pure cabernet fruit; there's savoury and meaty flavours on show, as well. These are big wines with generous dispositions.

    The Eureka Stockade of 1854 was a defining moment in the development of democracy in Australia.
     
     
    Blood on the Southern Cross tells the dramatic story of the Eureka Uprising by Ballarat's miners against unjust and corrupt colonial rulers.
     
     
    The show is set across Sovereign Hill's 64-acre site.  Under the stars, on moonlit diggings, audiences are surrounded by the action and, ultimately, caught in the crossfire as the battle rages.
     
     
    The production features state-of-the-art lighting and amazing special effects.  Peter Lalor is larger than life on an aqua screen.  Images of trapeze artists and acrobats fly across a huge circus tent.  The Eureka Hotel bursts into flame, and rain falls in a blinding storm.
     
     
    Blood on the Southern Cross runs for 90 minutes, seven nights a week (subject to availability).  Special packages are available that include entry to Sovereign Hill, dinner and accommodation at the Sovereign Hill Lodge.
     
     
    'State-of-the-art lighting and a dazzling array of special effects are the making of a great sound-and-light show - and Blood on the Southern Cross does not disappoint!'

    Blue Hills Orchards also known as Blue Hills Berries and Cherries is nestled in the foothills of the Dandenong  Ranges near the Silvan Reservoir, which has a beautiful picnic area. Silvan is renowned for its fruit, flowers and rich red soil.
     
     
    Owners, Murray and Lorraine Chapman are well established growers of berries and cherries. The Chapman family have farmed in Silvan since 1894 and are best known for their quality fresh fruit and provision of Pick Your Own berries and cherries.
     
     
    Blue Hills Orchards is the farm where u-pick first started in the area. It was on a patch of strawberries. Lorraine sat down the paddock with a pair of scales hanging from a cherry ladder with a few containers and a couple of signs up. 
    
     
    
    It wasn't long and customers wanted more varieties of berries and cherries added to the list they could pick.  They also built a cafe for light refreshments in the picking season. It is always best to make a booking for the cafe or the variety of fruit  you want to avoid disappointment.

    Bogong Estate are the Pinot People. 25 acres of pinot noir - nothing else. We live it , breathe it and drink more than our fair share of it. 
    
     
    
    At Bogong Estate we love to share our passion for pinot noir and this beautiful vineyard setting. We offer the usual cellar door experiences such as wine tastings, french style platters, a glass or 2 of pinot under a shady tree and a not so vigorous game of petanque. 
    
     
    
    What we really enjoy is running our Pinot Program. We spend the day with you walking the vineyard, sampling the wine in progress and finally blending and bottling a couple of dozen of your unique blend of pinot noir. The Pinot Program is great for one or more couples and small groups. It can be tailored to suit. The Pinot Program makes a fantastic and unique gift for the wine tragic.
     
     
    Indulge your winemaking fantasies without having to spend 2 million bucks and ten years!
     
     
    Stuff for wine buffs:
     
     
    The Tynan family produces a wide range of premium, handmade cool climate Pinot Noirs. The wines are all grown and made on site at Bogong Estate located high in the Kiewa Valley near Mt Beauty and the Falls Creek Ski Resort.
     
     
    Our wine region, Alpine Valleys, has a strong continental climate and is a classic cool climate region. It is a lot like Beechworth only colder.  
     
     
    Our pinots are hand-picked, crushed, and fermented in small open vats. We mainly use wild /natural yeast ferments. As a result we get full flavours and great character in the wine. To gently extract the essence of our cool climate pinot we hand plunge each batch many times daily and then softly basket press each batch. Our winemaking is labour intensive, gentle and we hope true to the traditions of Burgundy.

    What is Bonsai?
     
     
    Bonsai is a horticultural art. Woody plants are grown in shallow containers and styled to resembled scale-models of the mature tree in nature.
     
     
    Bonsai need sunlight, air movement, water, nutrients and a substrate in which to grow. That's the horticultural element, and it's the same as in any other form of gardening.
     
     
    The art of bonsai involves styling, training and pruning the tree to the shape you want and then matching it to a complementary container to create the desired overall effect - drama, strength, grace, elegance or whimsy.
     
     
    We teach that Bonsai is not about the age of the tree, per se - it is about the effectiveness and beauty of the design.  Come visit us soon, we look forward to welcoming you.

    Box Stallion has been operating since 2000. From the first vintage to the current vintage, many trophies, gold, silver and bronze medals and awards have been proudly gathered, not to mention the always-favourable press.
     
     
    2004 saw Box Stallion enter the export arena sending wine to America and Canada. 2006 saw Box Stallion begin exporting to China.
     
     
    Now savvy American, Canadian and Chinese wine drinkers are quietly sharing the pleasures of the diverse range of ultra premium, exclusive wines produced solely from the Box Stallion vineyards by veteran winemaker and industry icon Alex White.
     
     
    A hand picked list of leading restaurants across Victoria list our wines and continue to marvel at the reception and quality of the product. Our wines can also be found in boutique wine stores. Alex White has a long history of success in the wine industry particularly at St Huberts in the 80 s and in later years as a consultant to specialist wineries across southern Australia.
     
     
    He is now focused on producing wines of excellence for Box Stallion. This partnership continues to flourish and to receive awards and accolades across Australia and internationally.
     
     
    The wines of Box Stallion are new, fun & ambitious. This theme is reflected in the cellar door restaurant, the winner of the 2003   2004 Frankston & Mornington Peninsula Small Business Award for Tourism.
     
     
    Our cellar door caters for customers looking for a relaxed lunch from a carefully composed menu, in the unique surroundings of the now famous Red Barn. Lunch is not the only focus at the barn. The friendly hospitality includes live music on Sundays from some of the best musicians in the business.

    Nestled amongst golf courses, urban development and busy roads, it has the quality of an oasis. The park offers easy walking and cycling trails that meander through three very distinct environments -wetlands, heathland and red gum woodland. The 295ha offer a peaceful interlude with picturesque views. 
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Bring your bike and explore the 7 kilometres of trails 
     
    * Bring a picnic and use the free electric barbecues, or BYO gas barbecue
     
    * See the old racetrack where the mighty Phar Lap ran in 1930-31
     
    * Try to identify different birds in the many wetlands and billabongs
     
    * Call in and see the artist at work in the Art School
     
    * Play on the award-winning adventure playground
     
    * Go on a self-guided trail walk or observe the wildlife from the bird hide and observation decks
     
    * Join in a night walk and see the park after dark
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    The Bunurong people lived for many thousands of years in and around the area now called Braeside Park. Some 6 Aboriginal scar trees can be found in the park. 
     
     
    The first European family to settle here were the Keys, hence Keysborough. They ran cattle from 1844 to 1909. Their original homestead has been incorporated into the Southern Golf Club's clubhouse. Later, when the family sold the property, the land was developed for racehorse training and at one time was claimed to be the largest complex of its type in Australia. A sewage treatment plant, built in 1940, ran until 1980. When it closed, it presented an opportunity for a park to be developed in the area. Braeside Park opened in April 1989 with the completion of stage one of its development plan.
     
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * No dogs, cats or horses
     
    * Please take your litter home

    * Walk along the Australian Plant Trail and experience the colour and beauty of plants suitable for growing in the Keilor area
     
    * On weekends and holidays visit the maze

    * School groups - take your rubber boots and net, and see what is lurking in the shallows or wetland areas
     
     
    Heritage 
     
    Brimbank Park was first settled by Europeans in the 1830's, soon after Melbourne was founded. It derived its name from the practice of the locals driving their stock 'around the brim of the bank' of the Maribyrnong River. The rich river flats on the east bank were used for market gardening until 1983. Terraces formed by the eroding river were modified for cultivation.
     
     
    The Maribyrnong terraces have been closely studied for evidence of Aboriginal occupation. Keilor is one of the oldest sites of human habitation found in Australia. The Keilor cranium, dated to about 15,000 years before the present, was found in 1940 and the Green Gully skeleton in 1965. The excavations came to an end in 1982, but the site uncovered one of the most complete records of Aboriginal occupation over a period of 30,000 years. 
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * No dogs near Kulin Wetland nor at Horseshoe Bend Farm. Elsewhere, dogs must be on a leash
     
    * No trail or mini-bikes
     
    * Portable barbecues may be used in designated areas only
     
    * Groups above 50 should contact the Brimbank Park Office before visiting the park

    Little more than an hour's drive from Melbourne takes you to the state's richest wildflower habitat. Set in a low range of mountains dissected by rocky gullies, the unusual geology of Brisbane Ranges National Park has preserved plants that have long since vanished from the region, together with a correspondingly diverse bird population and the greatest density of koalas in Victoria.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
         
    * The 3 kilometre Anakie Gorge Walk leads through the gorge between the picnic areas at Anakie Gorge and Stony Creek. Nelsons Track climbs to the ridge top to Nelsons Lookout with views over the gorge and Lower Stony Creek Reservoir. This is a high standard walking track which uses small foot bridges to traverse several creek crossings
         
    * Panoramic views over much of the Stony Creek catchment can be had from the Outlook. An easy 2.5 kilometre return track, the Kurung Walk, climbs steadily from Stony Creek Picnic Area north to join Switch Road from where there are good views over the You Yangs and Anakie Gorge
         
    * The Burchell Trail is a three day walk through the park. Notes and a map for this walk can be obtained from the park office. Please note, from the 1 January 2009 a fee will be payable for overnight camping on the Burchell Trail.
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Brown Magpie Wines is located in the picturesque hinterland of the Surf Coast and Great Ocean Road, 15 minutes inland from Anglesea and Torquay, and 25 minutes south west of Geelong.
     
     
    Shane and Loretta Breheny selected the property specifically for the purpose. Planted in 2000 and 2001 the vineyard consists of 9 hectares of north facing gentle slope. Dense, well established cypress trees along the southern and western borders shelter the vineyard from strong and cold winds and moderates temperature. The vineyard is on the edge of the maritime zone, so frosts are rare, yet benefits from a more consistent inland climate.
     
     
    All wines are handcrafted on site from estate grown, hand picked fruit, and are a true reflection of the vineyard. The nine hectare vineyard is ideally located for producing premium quality shiraz, pinot noir, pinot gris, pinot grigio, sauvignon blanc, and sparkling wine.
     
     
    The quality of the wines has been acknowledged since our first vintage in 2003, with multiple gold medals and trophies being awarded. Recent awards include:
     
     
    Gold medal - Pinot Noir 2005, Winewise (National) Small Vigneron Awards, July 2008. Gold medal - Pinot Gris 2007, Federation Square Victorian Wine awards, June 2008. Gold Medal & Trophy - Shiraz 2006, Geelong Wine Show, October 2007
     
     
    The Surf Coast and Great Ocean Road hinterland is a treat for all wine and food lovers, abounding with great restaurants, farm gate produce and wineries.
     
     
    Brown Magpie Wines is open daily for cellar door tastings and sales from 12pm to 3pm, or by appointment.

    Near the township of Buchan, lies a honeycomb of caves full of spectacular limestone formations. Buchan Caves were formed by underground rivers cutting through limestone rock. The formations are created by rain water seeping through cracks and dissolving some of the limestone. As each droplet comes through the roof it deposits calcite which crystallises in a small ring. In time, stalactites are formed on the roof of the cave, and stalagmites build up from droplets which fall to the floor.
     
     
    The Caves Reserve was established to cater to the needs of the thousands of visitors who visit the caves each year. Camp sites, cabins and wilderness retreats are available in Buchan.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Visit the caves. Guided tours are conducted daily in Royal Cave and Fairy Cave. Both caves are lit and have walk-ways. Royal Cave has beautiful calcite-rimmed pools; Fairy Cave has elaborate stalactites and stalagmites
         
    * Special cave tours (some of which involve donning a helmet and light) for small groups are offered during the school holidays and may be organised by prior arrangement.
         
    * Walk the Spring Creek track (90 minutes return) and try the shorter walks in the area
         
    * Swim in the pool fed by a natural spring

    Buda Historic Home & Garden is one of the great heritage assets of the Goldfields region. Buda was built in 1861 and from 1863 was the home of noted silversmith Ernest Leviny and his family. Complete with the family's art and craft collections, furnishings and domestic effects. The gracious historic home that is surrounded by one of the most important large 19th century suburban gardens surviving in Victoria, was home to a remarkably creative Leviny family for a period of 118 years from 1863.
     
     
    In the house over this summer there is a cameo exhibition Kate Leviny (1877-1963) Photographer. Photographic equipment used by Kate will be on display alongside a selection of her more memorable artistic photographs, some of which were published in The Australian Photo-Review magazine between 1914 and 1922. 
     
     
    With three acres of enchanting gardens to explore, there is much to see and do. The plant nursery offers for sale a wide range of heritage trees, shrubs, roses and ground covers ideally suited for our current drought conditions. Or you can purchase some local produce and delightful craft items from Buda's Gift shop.
     
     
    Visitors can be assured of a very warm welcome to Buda Historic Home & Garden at any time of the year.

    Bulong Estate is a family owned and run vineyard, winery and restaurant. The 33 hectare vineyard is situated on the outskirts of the township of Yarra Junction in the upper reaches of the Yarra Valley - one of Australia's premium wine regions. The site was chosen by Howard and Judy Carter in 1994 for its unique combination of climate, aspect and soil and to provide our cellar door and restaurant with spectacular views across the Valley floor to the imposing Mount Donna Buang. 
     
     
    All winemaking and bottling is conducted on site. Our winemaker, Matthew Carter, has extensive experience both in Australia and overseas and his primary aim is to grow the best possible fruit in the first place. Over a number of years he has changed or modified a number of vineyard blocks in the quest for better and better fruit. Grape varieties grown at Bulong Estate include Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.
     
     
    Enjoy our wines at our modern and comfortable cellar door, surrounded by the beautiful vineyard. Wine tasting is available seven days a week, 11am to 5pm.
     
     
    The restaurant, opened in October 2006, provides a seasonal menu, using quality local produce with a French flair from our French Chef Antoine Cheron. 
     
     
    Open for Lunch: Friday to Sunday.

    Rugged sandstone cliffs along much of the boundary of the park are a striking backdrop for beach activities, featuring sandy coves, rocky headlands, caves and rock pinnacles. Many of these are accessible to sightseers, sunbathers, swimmers and budding explorers. 
     
    The George Bass Coastal Walk, adjacent to the park, offers panoramic coastal views from a narrow winding path, along clifftops rising high above the pounding surf of Bass Strait. The walk starts at the southern end of Punchbowl Road off the Phillip Island Tourist Road, is 7 kilometres long and takes 2 hours one way. 
     
    The seashore is a favourite place for all sorts of leisure activities like swimming, surfing, boating, fishing, rockpooling, or simply enjoying the spectacular scenery.
     
     
    Looking After the Park
    
     
    * Bins are not provided within the park. Please take your rubbish with you
     
    * Keep to defined tracks and steps and stay away from cliff edges and bases
     
    * After observing animals and plants on the rock platform, it is important to replace organisms and rocks you may have turned over
     
    * Many creatures live on the underside of rocks and rely on the moisture and shade for their survival. Other animals lay their eggs under rocks to protect them from dehydration and predators. A lot of needless damage is caused by careless people who discard fishing hooks, lines and sinkers, plastic six-pack holders, polystyrene containers and plastic bags. Such rubbish can trap birds, seals and penguins, often sentencing them to a painful, lingering death. So please don't litter the beaches or the water
     
    * Take the trouble to find out the regulations that apply to the different zones of the Bunurong Marine Park and abide by them. Encourage others to do the same so that this special area is maintained for everyone to enjoy.

    The future of top-end Australian Sauvignon Blanc is in Victoria and Tasmania.
     
     
    'Cannibal Creek, a small vineyard in Gippsland, Victoria, releases a tightly focused, austere and chalky wine that bursts with pristine herbal, floral aromas and vibrant gooseberry and citrus fruit. Its bony mouth feel more resembles a high-level Pouilly-Fume' (from France's Loire Valley) than an Australian wine. The newly released 2005 vintage should flesh out beautifully, retaining its cut and austerity'. Jeremy Oliver

    Spectacular coastal cliffs, diverse bird life, picturesque walks and picnic areas, and the unusual Soap Mallee (Eucalyptus diversifolia) which is restricted to Cape Nelson in Victoria, are some of the attractions for visitors to the 243 hectares Cape Nelson State Park, 11 km south west of Portland along the Cape Nelson Road.
     
     
    Things to Do
     
     
    Sightseeing 
     
    The Cape Nelson Lighthouse is one of the popular attractions in the area, with spectacular views of the surrounding coastal and inland environment to be gained by climbing the tower, as well as a greater appreciation of our maritime history.
     
     
    Picnics and barbecues 
     
    The quiet bush surroundings of the picnic areas are an ideal setting for a meal with family and friends. Wood barbecues and picnic tables are provided at all sites. As wood is not supplied, visitors must bring wood with them.
     
     
    Walking 
     
    The Sea Cliff Nature Walk (3km), the Lighthouse Walk (6km) and the Great South West Walk offer excellent walking opportunities for everyone. All these walks are linked, providing the opportunity to walk as little or as much as desired.
     
     
    Nature study 
     
    The Sea Cliff Nature Walk gives an introduction to the natural history of the area. You can watch sea and land birds, kangaroos, echidnas, snakes and lizards. It's a good idea to take binoculars and bird and plant books. Note the limestone overlying the basalt of rock platforms near sea level.
     
     
    Coastal cliffs 
     
    Experience magnificent sea views and the beautiful coastal environment, but please stay on the track and keep away from cliff edges as some may be unstable.

    Completed in 1848 and constructed of sandstone, it was only the second lighthouse constructed on mainland Australia.
     
     
    In 1859, one of the earliest telegraph stations in Australia was added to the facility, soon connecting Tasmania to the mainland through Cape Otway and Melbourne.
     
     
    First whale oil, then kerosene, was used to keep the light burning. Later changes included diesel generators, electricity, radio and global positioning satellites. In 1994, the introduction of satellite navigation systems caused the 'old light' to be turned off and replaced with a small solar powered beacon.
     
     
    At the beginning of 1997, the Lightstation was leased to a local company, to operate for tours and accommodation for visitors.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
         
    * Take a tour of the 18 metre Lighthouse. Tours are conducted daily at 11am, 2pm and 3pm. Self guided tours occur from 9am until 4.45pm. Entrance fees apply
         
    * Visit the cafe located in the Assistant Lighthouse Keepers cottage
         
    * Spend the night in the accommodation available in the Head Lighthouse Keepers Residence
         
    * Take a walk in magnificent rainforest of the neighbouring Otway National Park.

    The Castlemaine Diggings National Heritage Park, stretching from north of Chewton, south through the Fryerstown and Vaughan Springs areas, encompasses an area of approximately 7,500 hectares. Most of the area is covered with regrowth box-ironbark forest which has been harvested to supply fuel and timber for mines and other local industry.
     
     
    Things to do 
    
    
    
         
    * At the site of the 22 metre Garfield Water Wheel there is a walking track that explains the links between the mine, the stamping battery and the water wheel
         
    * Spring Gully and Eureka Reef are great areas to visit and view as they represent the many mining relics scattered throughout the Reserve. These relics can also be appreciated by following the Mount Alexander Diggings routes. There are also the ruins of an old Welsh Village, other ruined house sites and mineral springs at Vaughan
         
    * Camping at Vaughan Springs provides easy access for regular size caravans and a grassed tent area for those walking the Great Dividing Trail or those after a more basic camping experience. The popular site has a rich cultural history and natural beauty and camping offers visitors the chance to enjoy an extended stay
         
    * In spring, a sharp eye will spot many beautiful wildflowers ranging from wattles to orchids
         
    * Scenic driving, bushwalking, cycling, guided tours and gold fossicking are some of the popular activities in this area
         
    * Fishing for trout, redfin, tench and blackfish is also a popular activity along the Loddon River.
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Due to current or recent fires, parks and reserves in the following areas have been closed (correct at 11 February 2009):
    
     
    * Kinglake National Park 
    
     
    * Toorourrong Reservoir Park 
     
    * Cathedral Range State Park 
     
    * Lake Eildon National Park 
     
    * Yarra Ranges National Park 
     
    * Mount Donna Buang 
     
    * Rainforest Gallery 
     
    * Badger Weir Picnic Area 
     
    * Donnelleys Weir 
     
    * Warramate Hills Nature Conservation Reserve 
    
     
    * Upper Yarra Reservoir Park closure is also likely.
    
     
     
    The Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges region is home to some of Victoria's most impressive tall forests. Once logged to make masts for ships, the area is now a haven for lyrebirds, and a great place to walk, cycle, picnic or sit and relax. Follow the many walks and trails through stands of towering 100 metre high mountain ash, undulating seas of tree ferns, across clear gushing streams and past thundering waterfalls. And for those not keen to leave the comfort of their car, some of the best scenery is accessible by road too.
     
     
    The Cathedral Range is a spectacular 7 km ridge of sharply upturned sedimentary rock. A variety of walking tracks offer the opportunity to climb the peaks and enjoy views of the forests and farmland in the valley below. 
    
      
    
    Things to Do
    
         
    * The park is ideal for bushwalking, rock climbing, fishing and camping.
         
    * Walking tracks lead to all the major features of the park and range in difficulty from an easy walk along the Little River between Neds Gully and Cooks Mill to the very challenging, steep walk between Sugarloaf Saddle and Sugarloaf Peak which involves climbing up rock faces. Many of the walking tracks are steep and rough.
         
    * Camp by a clear mountain stream surrounded by the splendour of the Cathedral Range and its spectacular peaks. Camping is permitted at three sites: Neds Gully, Cooks Mill and the Farmyard.
         
    * Take your caravan to Cooks Mill which has areas suitable for a small number of caravans.

    The 'you've found us' exclamation on the sign at the front gate gives visitors to this rustic cellar door a glimpse of the unique wine experience available within.
     
     
    The first thing you notice is the impressive array of bottles on the tasting bar where you will find more than 30 different wines, including many lesser-known wines such as Muscadelle, Blue Imperial and Chasselas in the line up. Look out for a particularly interesting variety called Gouais which is a parent plant of Chardonnay.
     
     
    Another surprise is the friendly invitation to sample the wines as there is no pressure. The lack of pretence is beautifully explained in the very amusing pricing policy poster displayed on the wall.
     
     
    Rosewood's gnarled old low-yielding vines, many of which are almost 90 years old, yield fruit brimming with highly concentrated flavours for their world renowned Muscat, Tokay and Port styles.
     
     
    Now celebrating 150 years since settling in Rutherglen, the family still operates from the original site. The laconic Bill ChambersOAM is often to be found at the cellar door over the weekends but it is his son Stephen who now makes the wine. Stephen took over the winemaking function in 2001 and is Rosewood's 6th generation. This small winery is truly a treasure trove and not to be missed.

    Chanters Ridge is a boutique, family owned and operated vineyard established in 1996 in the Macedon Ranges Wine Region 45 minutes drive north from Melbourne Airport.
     
     
    From this cool climate vineyard Glenys and Barry Elliott produce premium Pinot Noir, both still and sparkling and our sparkling Macedon white.
     
     
    Grapes are picked by hand in late April to early May. With our wine maker John Ellis at Hanging Rock we strive to achieve varietal characteristics of nose and palate using open vat whole bunch fermentation, the maturation in 30per cent new French and older oak barrels.
     
     
    Our newer planting, Back Paddock are 2 years younger than the original vines.  
    
    Chanters Ridge Back Paddock Pinot Noir 2003 won a gold medal and the trophy for Best Pinot Noir at the Macedon Ranges Wine Exhibition 2005.
     
     
    The 2003 Pinot Noir a silver in both 2005 and 2006  and the 2004 Back Paddock a silver at the 2006 Macedon Ranges Wine Exhibition with James Halliday being the senior judge.
     
     
    Our 2005 wines are showing great promise having recently been bottled, but will not be released for about 18 months. The views of the surrounding countryside from the vineyard are fantastic and the 1 Ha garden worth a wander through particularly in spring and early summer.

    Cheetham Wetlands consists of lagoons and saltmarsh of varying salinity levels created through the activities of a Saltworks that used to operate in the area. Deliberate creation of a number of relatively shallow ponds provides an environment which attracts many birds who like to feed on vegetation, insects, larvae and other small animals both in the water and on the pond floor.
     
     
    At different times, Cheetham Wetlands has been home to over two hundred species of birds. Many birds return year after year, travelling 9,000 - 19,000 km to this wetland habitat to feed and roost in the area. These birds breed mainly in the northern hemisphere during June and July and migrate southwards between July and November.
     
     
    The Wetlands are protected, through international agreements, as important habitats for wildlife and are not open to the public. The only way to view the wetlands is from the observation tower.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Located 7kms North of Daylesford, Chocolate Mill is in a strawbale building designed and built by ourselves.
     
     
    We pride ourselves on being for the Serious Chocoholic. We make fresh chocolate the old fashioned European way, before mass production took over.   Our idea was to create something from scratch, the way things used to be made. Right from the construction of the strawbale building to the way we make our chocolates and now run our business.
     
     
    By using natural ingredients and quality European chocolate- staying away from preservatives and additives. And going back to quality personal customer service with strong product knowledge.   This is why we make and sell our product exclusively on site to over 2000 customers per week. We melt down over a tonne of chocolate per month that's imported from Belgium.  
     
     
    Our story...   
     
     
    In 2001, we, Jennifer Gregory and Chris Weippert, moved from Perth into a shed on the property. Here we lived for 28 months, 18 months without power and budgeted for AUD7 a day for food for the two of us, while building. On November 21st 2003, with AUD22 in the bank, we opened. Later that year we were featured in Epicure and The Herald Sun

    Habitat types represented within the Marine National Park include seagrass beds, mangroves, sheltered intertidal mudflats, sandy beaches, subtidal soft sediments and rocky intertidal shores, which provide habitat for a range of important marine fish and invertebrate species.
     
     
    The park forms part of the Western Port Ramsar site, and contains significant roosting and feeding sites for migratory waders. The intertidal mud flats extending from Rhyll to Newhaven are of State significance, and the area from Rhyll Inlet to Churchill island is of national significance as part of a group of primary foraging sites for the 32 migratory waders found in Western Port (especially whimbrels and bartailed godwits).
     
     
    Looking After the Park 
     
    For the protection of the marine environment, a number of activities are prohibited within the boundaries of Victoria's marine national parks and marine sanctuaries. No fishing, netting, spearing, taking or killing of marine life. All methods of fishing, from the shore or the sea, are prohibited. Minimise your impact on these areas by:
    
     
    * Enjoy the marine environment without removing the plants and animals
     
    * Minimise your impact while diving and snorkelling by: 
    being careful to avoid damage to marine life caused by fins  
    developing good skills in buoyancy control 
    securing all gauges and pressure hoses to avoid snagging them on objects
     
    * Take any rubbish home with you
     
    * Avoid stressing marine life by not chasing or grabbing free-swimming animal
     
    * Exercise great care if approached by large marine animals (including birds) & avoid blocking their paths if moving
     
    * Take care where you anchor your boat (anchor in sand, rubble or mud, avoiding sensitive areas, and use mooring buoys where provided)
     
    * Do not pollute the water with sewage - ensure that if your vessel has an onboard toilet that it has an approved sewage holding facility and that sewage is disposed of appropriately on land

    Churchill National Park at Rowville in Melbourne's south-eastern suburbs is a remnant of natural bush and an example of the original landscape before clearing and settlement. Although most of the park is open regrowth woodland, there are small areas of original forest. Apart from the access road, there are no other vehicle tracks.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Tracks throughout the park are ideal for peaceful walks. Channel Track, running beside the old aqueduct, wanders through a thickly wooded landscape
         
    * Some of the tracks are also suitable for jogging and cycling, particularly the eastern boundary track
         
    * There are plenty of spots for birdwatching. One particularly good one is by a dam along the northern boundary track. Picnic grounds are provided at the end of the access road
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Ciavarella Oxley Estate: a small winery at Oxley in Victoria's King Valley wine region, 1km off the Snow Road, a scenic route to many attractions and gateway to the King Valley and Milawa Gourmet Region.Establishing vineyards in 1978, Cyril and Jan Ciavarella began making wines in 1992, after initially selling grapes to others. Ciavarella Oxley Estate has a reputation for quality and varietal flavour. Wines are hand-made in small volumes by Cyril, Jan and Tony Ciavarella. They take a very hands-on approach, working to no fixed timetable. The philosophy is simple: make wines that people will love!
     
     
    Wines include: chenin blanc, sauvignon blanc, viognier, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, durif, Dolcino (a sweet red), Late Harvest Semillon Aucerot and a fortified white.
     
     
    Awards and critiques
     
     
    The small volumes made often exclude wine-show entry. Wines entered consistently win medals and receive high praise from critics. High achievers:
    
         
    * Chardonnay (13 vintages): 3 gold, 1 silver, 8 bronze; 4 stars Winestate; 4 cups James Halliday; a hat-trick of 'best chardonnay in show', Dookie Wine Show 2007-2009;
         
    * Durif (5 vintages): 4 cups James Halliday; 3 stars and 4 stars Ric Einstein
         
    * Shiraz and Shiraz Viognier (5 vintages): 1 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze; 3 and 4 1/2 stars Winestate; 3 stars Ric Einstein; 3 cups James Halliday;
         
    * Late Harvest Semillon Aucerot (2 vintages): 2 bronze; 4 stars Winestate;Cabernet Sauvignon (11 vintages): 2 bronze; 4 1/2 stars Winestate; 3 stars Ric Einstein; 4 cups James Halliday.
    
     
     
     
    
    Aucerot - mystery 
    
     
    
    As custodians of the variety aucerot, Ciavarellas use it in dessert and fortified wines. Cuttings collected from Europe by Varley Bailey in the early 1900s were planted at Glenrowan. Cyril obtained cuttings before their removal in the 1980s. The name aucerot is not used in Europe; exact heritage is unknown. The planting is thought the only one in Australia.

    The Old Treasury is regarded as one of the finest public buildings in Australia. Completed in 1862, it was the major government office in Melbourne throughout the 19th century, and second only to Parliament House as the centre of state affairs.
     
     
    Designed by a 19 year old architect, John James Clark, it is widely considered to be one of the finest examples of Renaissance Revival architecture in Australia.
     
     
    Until 1992, the building housed a succession of government departments including the city office of the Victorian Governor.
     
     
    Restored and opened to the public as a museum in 1994, the City Museum at Old Treasury provides an ideal orientation to Melbourne for visitors wishing to understand and explore the city's history, architecture, art and contemporary life.
     
     
    The City Museum at Old Treasury houses three permanent exhibitions, Built on Gold, Making Melbourne and Growing Up in the Old Treasury.

    This is one of those out-of-the-way gems that make Victorian vineyard touring so fascinating. Cobaw Ridge is a clearing in an unspoilt forest strewn with giant boulders. There's a real middle of nowhere feel, yet it's not much more than an hour from Melbourne.
     
     
    Comforts include picnic area, casual terrace tables, and a rustic mudbrick winery which produces distinctive cool-climate wines.
     
     
    Shiraz, straight or in a blend with Viognier, and Chardonnay are typically fresh and lively, and the unique Lagrein is a savoury, Italian-varietals red of real interest. Ralph Kyte-Powell
     
     
    Certified organic (NASAA), adopting biodynamic practices. Alan and Nelly Cooper's five ha vineyard, justly renowned for multi-layered, wheatmealy chardonnay, peppery shiraz/viognier ( syrah) and the best lagrein in the country, achieved full organic certification in 2009.'' Max Allen

    Max Cofield has been making wines since 1964 and has earned a well-deserved reputation for being a master at making Sparkling Shiraz.
     
     
    These days Max's son Damien oversees the winemaking and the wines are almost elegant in comparison to some of the more heroic styles of the district.
     
     
    The Sparkling Shiraz is, of course, brilliant and you should buy as many bottles of it as Max will let you put in the boot of your car. Ben Canaider
     
     
    The story of Cofield wines began in 1985 when Max Cofield was feeling in need of a hobby. His wife Karen told him  your hobby can t be winemaking   it needs to be different from what you do for a living . 
     
     
    Max listened dutifully, then bought a piece of steel and spent the rest of winter drilling the holes for his first grape crusher so began his first 'shed wine' and Cofield Wines was born.
     
     
    Max & Karen have now retired and handed over the reins to the next generation   two of their sons Damien (winemaker) and Andrew (vineyard manager). A hobby indeed!
     
     
    Visit us and share our love of all things wine, have a chat over a glass of bubbles and become part of the extended Cofield Wines family.
     
     
    You're always welcome at Cofield Wines.

    Coldstream Hills is the creation of James Halliday, Australia's doyen of wine writing (and just about everything else to do with wine). James is still around to offer a consulting hand at the winery, although he no longer owns the property. The cellar door looks across the lovely pastoral landscape of the Yarra Valley towards the northern hills. It's a comfortable place to taste the excellent Coldstream Hills range, and chat with the knowledgeable staff about the wines. Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are the mainstays here, and the Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon can be superb. Ralph Kyte-Powell.

    Coliban Valley 
    
     
    
    The vineyard was established in 1997, with four hectares under vine. The plantings include Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It is set amongst the picturesque rolling hills of the Coliban River valley, at the south-west corner of the Heathcote wine region. The site was carefully chosen for its deep granitic soil over a band of clay. In summer the climate is warm but the nights are cool, which is ideal for fully ripening fruit over a longer period to produce elegant wines of intense aroma, colour and flavour, with fine grain tannins. During establishment the vines were irrigated but have been dry grown since 2003. They are looking better every year despite the dry conditions of the last few years. Their roots have developed to find their own water. Each year the crop quality is protected from bird damage by netting the entire vineyard.   
    
     
    
    The wines are entirely estate grown, produced and bottled using traditional methods, hand picked, hand plunged, basket pressed and aged for 12 months in predominantly French oak. The first release was the 2001 Cabernet Merlot which received several bronze medals. The 2002 Cabernet Merlot was awarded a gold medal and the Frangos & Frangos Trophy for  The best Cabernet or Cabernet blend  at the 2003 Daylesford Wine Show. The Coliban Valley 2004 Shiraz was awarded a gold medal and the trophy for the  best wine in the show  amongst a line up of 70 local wines judged by John Ellis at the Kyneton Show. 
    
     
    
    In James Halliday s 2007 Australian Wine Companion the winery achieved a 5-star rating for the 2004 vintage. 
    
     
    
    The Cellar door is simple and friendly, in the shed amongst the barrels.

    At the beginning of the 19thcentury, the British government decided to establish a settlement at Port Phillip and Sullivan Bay was chosen because of its strategic location near the entrance of the Bay. The settlement is significant because it was the first attempt to settle Europeans permanently in what is now Victoria. 
     
     
    A small part of Collins Settlement Historic Site was acquired in 1982 by the State Governement, with the help of public donations. Friends of Collins Settlement Sorrento Inc. assist with managing the area.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Explore the revegetated area and absorb the history of Victoria's first settlement
     
    * Visit the Nepean Historical Society Museum in Sorrento
     
     
    Please note: As of Monday 20th May 2002, the Collins Settlement Historic Site Display Centre (Sorrento) is closed to the public. The closure was brought on due to the instability of the cliff face below the Display Centre. A geo-technical report confirmed the instability thus the building is unsafe for public use.

    Australian Tourism Award Winner, the Convent Gallery in Daylesford offers a wide range of experiences. This 19th Century Victorian mansion was built in the 1860's as the private residence for the Gold Commissioner, the building was purchased by the Catholic Church in the 1880's and was a convent and boarding school for nearly 100 years. Left in disrepair, the site was purchased by artist Tina Banitska in 1989. Over the past 15 years she has tirelessly and meticulously restored the building and grounds, highlighting its original splendour and combining aspects of contemporary architecture and art into the fabric of the building. 
    
     
    
    Uniting history, spirituality, art and culture all under one roof, The Convent houses seven galleries featuring work by over 100 local, national and international artists. Featuring fine art, sculpture, limited edition prints, ceramics, glassware and textiles, the exhibition program, changing every eight weeks, showcases a diverse array of traditional and contemporary artwork. 
     
     
    The Convent retail areas specialize in jewellery, fashion and accessories, produce and unique gifts. The sunlit Mediterranean cafe produces world-class fare in a relaxing and art filled environment. The stylish lounge bar is perfect for intimate rendezvous and vibrant get togethers and is open late on Friday and Saturday nights. The most recent developments to the building include an architecturally designed function centre, perfect for weddings, parties and conferences. The views over Daylesford and beyond are unforgettable. Also housing the original chapel and a secret penthouse apartment, and surrounded by six acres of fragrant gardens, The Convent is like no other place on earth. Leave the hustle and bustle of the city behind and get inspired as you enjoy the tranquillity of Daylesford's natural beauty.

    Coopracambra National Park is one of the most remote sections of Victoria and remains largely undisturbed. The red sandstone gorge of the Genoa River and the surrounding granite peaks form some outstanding scenery. The 35,000ha park protects high conservation values with undisturbed ecosystems, a heritage river, rare flora and fauna and diverse landscape values.
     
     
    Things to see and do
     
     
    A 2 kilometre drive along the W.B. Line from the Monaro Highway brings you to a short walking track to the cascading Beehive Falls. The road beyond this point becomes 4-wheel drive only. The heli-pad at Mealing Hill, adjacent to the W.B. Line, gives excellent views of the area including Mt Kaye, Yambula Peak (South East Forests National Park in NSW) and the south to the coast.
     
     
    The Genoa Wilderness Area provides for self-reliant recreation. Only experienced and well-equipped hikers should undertake walks in the rugged and remote parts of this park. A 'Trip Intentions' form needs to be lodged by hikers at the Cann River or Mallacoota Office of Parks Victoria prior to departure and parks staff notified upon return.
     
     
    The nearest campgrounds and facilities are in Cann River, Genoa or Mallacoota.
     
     
    Precautions
    
     
    * Hikers should remember that during dry weather water may be scarce, and that the creek and river levels can rise rapidly after heavy rain in the catchment
     
    * Only experienced and well equipped hikers should undertake walks in the rugged and remote areas of this park. Notify a friend or relative of your trip intentions.

    The Marine National Park samples a small part of this important sheltered inlet adjacent to the wilderness coast of Wilsons Promontory and is part of the Corner Inlet Ramsar site that protects the habitat for migratory wading birds.
     
     
    Corner Inlet is the most easterly, and consequently the warmest, of Victoria's large bays. It boasts a complex network of mangroves, saltmarsh, mud banks, seagrass beds, rocky islands and deeper channels. Corner Inlet supports huge numbers of migratory water birds and healthy populations of seafloor animals and plants that are rare or absent elsewhere in Victoria.
     
     
    Things to do 
    
     
    
    Corner Inlet is a popular visitor destination attracting an estimated 150,000 visitor days per year. Recreational opportunities offered by the marine national park include boating, swimming, sea kayaking, wind surfing, nature appreciation and some diving. Within Corner Inlet licensed tour operators offer a range of activities including sea kayaking and boat tours.

    One of Australia's great Shiraz producers, Pat Carmody carefully and quietly goes about his business crafting wines of wonderful balance, length and gentle power. The Shiraz is spicy and peppery with yummy squashed summer berry flavours and a savoury hint to finish; Cabernet is similarly impressive, with deep, ripe and concentrated cassis notes; and Chardonnay is complex and generous without being too blousy, as many Australian Chardonnays tend to be. Overlook this cellar door at your peril. Ben Canaider

    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Pleasure driving along 'The Boulevard', which follows the northern bank of the river, through forests of Brown Stringybark, Manna Gum and lush tree-fern lined gullies, is a beautiful way to discover the Park.
     
    * Camping at Hiscocks Crossing and picnicking along 'The Boulevard' is popular
     
    * Fishing is challenging, with species such as Redfin and Rainbow Trout to be caught. Freshwater crayfish are also found in the river
     
    * Bushwalking through the Park is relaxing and enjoyable. There are numerous bird species to view and vegetation types to discover. A return 2.5 km nature trail from the Hiscocks Crossing camping area takes you along the river's edge through lush vegetation and then higher up into wet and dry sclerophyll forests
     
    * Nature study in the variety of habitats makes the area valuable for students and photography enthusiasts alike. A quiet observer can discover a range of animals and botanists can enjoy the floristic diversity of the region.
     
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * All native animals and plants are protected
     
    * Fires may be lit only in fireplaces provided
     
    * Firearms are not permitted in the park
     
    * Vehicles must stay on formed roads
     
    * Removal of wood or plants from the park is prohibited
     
    * Leave the park as you find it
     
     
    Precautions
    
     
    * Keep to the tracks provided as there are areas of poor drainage that require stabilisation
     
    * Wear appropriate clothing to guard against the leeches that inhabit damp areas
     
    * Be cautious when entering as the descent from the Greenwald end of the park is steep

    Creswick Woollen Mills is the home of luxurious, natural fibre products designed in Australia to suit Australian conditions.
     
     
    Founded in 1947 by Polish migrant, Paul Ryzowy, Creswick Woollen Mills is now the only coloured woollen spinning mill of its type in Australia.
     
     
    Over 50 Australian mills of this type have closed in the face of competition from cheap imports in recent years, but Creswick remains, employing over 30 people directly and a further 80 indirectly across Victoria through its contractors and suppliers.
     
     
    Located in Creswick, a small township approximately 120km from Melbourne, north-east of Ballarat, Creswick Woollen Mills is the largest private employer in the region.
     
     
    Despite the rationalisation of the textile industry in recent times, the privately owned company remains buoyant, reinvesting for future sustainability.
     
     
    Some of Creswick Woollen Mills' luxurious products manufactured at the mill include Alpaca throws, blankets and accessories woven into sophisticated modern designs.  Other natural fibre products designed by Creswick for optimum comfort include merino, cashmere, cotton and bamboo. 
    
     
    
    Other innovative products produced at the Creswick Mills include the Personal Protection Blankets for The Country Fire Authority (CFA) Victoria and the Rural Fire Service (RFS) New South Wales. 
    
     
    
    Creswick Woollen Mills has become a household name both in Australia and globally. Creswick's continued success is attributed to ongoing research and innovation, as well as dedication to quality and an understanding that the Australian market appreciates exclusive designs and high quality.

    Garry Crittenden a leading figure in the Australian wine industry for 25 years, now works alongside son Rollo in their family company Crittenden Estate.
     
     
    Rollo and Garry are dedicated small scale vignerons with an exciting new series of handcrafted wines and produce. Their efforts are being channelled into producing small batches of wines that elegantly and emphatically speak of their varietal and geographic provenance.
     
     
    The company's wines are divided into four distinct ranges, Crittenden, Pinocchio, Geppetto and the new Los Hermanos. Those bottled under the flagship Crittenden brand are classic varietals of French origin, produced mainly from mature vines growing on the estate at Dromana on the Mornington Peninsula: Sauvignon Blanc Semillon, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir and Cabernet. Pinocchio is the brand encompassing Rollo and Garry's latest foray into the fascinating world of Italian varietals: Moscato, Arneis, Rosato, Dolcetto and Barbera.Geppetto meanwhile, includes wines Garry has specialized in for many years, but which are sourced from both the Peninsula and other prime grape producing regions of Victoria. The Los Hermanos range, consisting of Spanish varietals, is the latest addition and is the result of a collaboration between Rollo and sister Zoe. Los Hermanos is Spanish for the siblings. The aromatic white Albarino was the first to be released under this label and will be followed by a red, Tempranillo.
     
     
    Produce is also available in the Geppetto range: Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Verjus, Dukkah, Cogna and Vinocotto.

    Launched in 1991, Dalfarras wines are a reflection of the individual skills of Alister Purbrick (chief winemaker & C.E.O. at Tahbilk) and his artist wife Rosa.
     
     
    Alister uses local Nagambie Lakes fruit, along with selections from other premium wine-producting regions in Australia, to produce crowd-pleasing styles crafted for immediate enjoyment.
     
     
    They are then dressed to impress with selected works from Rosa's extensive portfolio of artworks reproduced on the labels.
     
     
    In August 2005 Dalfarras found its home with the opening of the Tahbilk Wetlands Cafe.
     
     
    The contemporary design and striking impact of the Cafe provided the ideal venue to showcase not only the Dalfarras range of wines but also selected artworks from Rosa's collection.
     
     
    Both the varietals offered and featured artworks have changed and developed over time as you would expect from such a progressive label.
     
     
    This is no better highlighted than with the current offerings featuring both traditional and innovative varietal blendings - Marsanne/Viognier, Shiraz/Viognier, Viognier/Pinot Gris and Cabernet/Sangiovese, alongside established straight varietal favourites - Sauvignon Blanc & Shiraz - with Rosa drawing her inspiration for the labels dressing these releases from the Wetlands area itself.
     
     
    Visitors to the Wetlands Cafe and Dalfarras Tasting Bar and Gallery can enjoy unique and exclusive varietal wines, contemporary cafe fare, gallery exhibitions, a cruise (or walk) in the Wetlands and Wildlife Reserve - or all the above!

    Dalwhinnie is one of Victoria s greatest wine estates, making wines that are regional highpoints. A little more isolated than most Pyrenees vineyards, Dalwhinnie nestles under the brow of a hill with lovely views of vineyard and ranges from the modern glass-walled tasting room. Facilities are being expanded to cope with ever-increasing demand for the estate s superb, ageworthy Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, and complex Chardonnay, but the hands-on approach of David Jones won t change. The occasional Eagle Shiraz is expensive, but it s a modern Australian classic. Ralph Kyte-Powell

    Covering an area of 499ha, the reserve has significant cultural and environmental values. It contains Aboriginal cultural heritage sites, areas of significant indigenous vegetation and a number of sporting venues. The reserve is being developed to strengthen and enhance the area as a spiritual and historic place in which people can experience cultural and natural environments and undertake recreational pursuits in a quality rural setting.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * The Dandenong Police Paddocks has a diverse combination of rural bushland, cultural heritage and sporting areas.
     
    * There are recreational opportunities for walkers, cyclists, bird watchers, dog owners, golfers, athletes and many more.
     
    * Nerre Nerre Warren Picnic Area, at the end of Brady Road, is a newly developed picnic area that caters for a range of visitors.
     
    * Stroll along one of the many trails in the area that form a network in the Dandenong Police Paddocks Reserve. There is a short 700 metre walk to the rear of the picnic area that is suitable for visitors with limited mobility.
     
    * An information shelter in the picnic area provides history and reports on future developments.
     
    * For a more hands-on approach, consider joining the Friends of Dandenong Police Paddocks Group, the group has planted thousands of native plants, rehabilitated a wetland area, constructed and installed nestboxes and participated in many Clean Up Australia days.

    In 1987 Sherbrooke Forest, Doongalla Reserve and Ferntree Gully National Park were combined to form Dandenong Ranges National Park. Covering 3215 hectares, the park plays an important role in protecting a population of famous lyrebirds and other fauna, as well as protecting the forests and fern gullies of the Ranges. Since June 1997 Olinda State Forest and the Mt Evelyn Forest have also been included in Dandenong Ranges National Park.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Scenic drives through the Ranges are just as popular now as they have been for many years.
         
    * Enjoy a picnic at the Fern Tree Gully Picnic Ground or at One Tree Hill or in Sherbrooke Forest.
         
    * Near the park are coffee shops and restaurants, bed and breakfasts, craft shops, antique shops, gardens and the historic Puffing Billy train from Belgrave to Gembrook.
         
    * Numerous walking tracks are excellent for short family strolls or longer hikes
         
    * Try spotting the famous Lyrebird or just enjoy being surrounded by the native fauna. The park is rich in wildlife with 130 native bird species, 31 native mammals, 21 reptiles and nine amphibian species recorded.
    
     
     
    The park is a day visit area and camping is not permitted. However, there are many B&Bs in and around the Dandenongs that are popular for short weekend breaks.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

Sited along the Snowy River, the national park is in a remote wilderness area and features some magnificent scenery, spectacular deep gorges and forests of Grey Gum, Alpine Ash, Messmate and Native Pine. It\xE2\x80\x99s a challenging drive with some steep climbs and descents, and the beauty of the surrounding country, the great camping and the lack of other travellers makes it a great Australian touring experience. The Deddick Trail also passes through state forest and alongside the Rodger River Wilderness, an incredibly pristine area of streams and fauna. McKillops Bridge is the finishing point of the Deddick Trail, and one of the few places in the national park where you can access the Snowy River by conventional vehicle. Just upstream of the bridge are wide sandy beaches, where you can swim in shallow rock pools between the rapids."

    Dinny Goonan Family Estate is one of a handful of families pioneering grape and wine production in the Otway hinterland. 
    
     
    
    Our wines have won numerous awards since the first commercial release in 2001. 
    
     
    
    Our vineyard and cellar door are conveniently situated on the inland road to Lorne, between Winchelsea and Deans Marsh.  This location provides a great springboard to explore the Otways and surrounding attractions, and we're happy to share some local knowledge of other places to see and visit. 
    
     
    
    Visitors are welcome to taste our wines and relax in our peaceful vineyard setting.  You can find out more about the wines by talking to Dinny the winemaker, or stroll around the vineyard and winery. 
    
     
    
    Vineyard platters are available on weekends between November and April and every day during January, so it is a great chance to take some time out to enjoy our wines, surrounded by the vines that produced them.  The platters have a regional focus providing the opportunity to match local wines with regional produce.  The only distractions will come from the Crimson Rosellas and Blue Winged Grass Parrots that have made the vineyard their home. 
    
     
    
    We also offer a great coffee and a selection of local foodstuffs and oils. 
    
     
    
    And then of course, there are our award winning wines. 
    
     
    
    As a family run enterprise, everything is very much hands on.  Our vines are hand pruned; we pick the grapes by hand and use traditional vinification and elevage techniques within our modern winery. 
    
     
    
    We specialize in the production of cool climate Shiraz and Riesling. 
    
     
    
    We also produce limited quantities of Cabernets (a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec), a Semillon / Sauvignon and a Sparkling wine (a blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay) which are available exclusively to our cellar door customers.

    Things to Do
     
     
    On calm day, a snorkel around the rocks can be very rewarding. The Marine Sanctuary is also popular for recreational diving with a diverse range of fish species present.
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    The area of the Marine Sanctuary is inter-related with Painkalac Creek, which is a highly significant cultural place for Aboriginal people. Eastwards of Painkalac Creek is soft sand, which Aboriginal groups believe indicate an extremely high possibility of burial sites.
     
     
    Precautions
     
     
    For your own safety, only undertake activities appropriate to your skills and abilities. Take all necessary precautions, be aware of changing conditions, and watch for potential hazards, such as rips. A number of Victorian marine animals are potentially harmful if not treated with respect and care, so ensure that you familiarise yourself with these species. Sunburn and hypothermia are also potentially harmful but easily avoided.
     
     
    SCUBA diving is a potentially high-risk activity and should only be undertaken by appropriately qualified people that have completed recognised training and certification. Victoria's cool water environments can be extremely challenging to those used to diving in warmer waters so ensure that local knowledge is sought before undertaking a dive in a new location. Dive charter operators can provide some of the best advice on diving in Victoria.

    One of the two northern and warmer vineyards of the region growing Pinot Noir and Chardonnay in shallow basalt soils. Norm Latta is producing very stylish and classy wines, and honestly so - letting the strong regional qualities show through. Chardonnay is rounded and full, but with the characteristic Ballarat citrus and steel backbone; Pinot Noir is structured, with good weight and gaminess. Both have real finesse. The Rose and unwooded Chardonnay are serious wines, and seriously delicious. Ben Canaider

    * Take a self-guided walk through the heart of the rainforest at Errinundra Saddle
         
    * Enjoy a scenic drive which closely follows the route taken by the explorer Walter Baldwin Spencer.

    The first Fifteen restaurant in the Southern Hemisphere opened in Melbourne in September 2006 and immediately was the hottest dining ticket in town. The Naked Chef Jamie Oliver swept into town to launch Fifteen Melbourne, the fourth restaurant he has established to help underprivileged kids.
     
     
    The menu takes advantage of Victoria's excellent produce, with simple Italian-inspired dishes that allow the ingredients to shine. Fifteen Melbourne offers a six-course degustation menu and boasts 550 wines on an impressive wine list.
     
     
    The restaurant fit-out reflects the international Fifteen branding, incorporating signature pink hues and graffiti motifs and blending old and new furnishings. A key feature is a 'theatre' kitchen that allows diners to watch the young chefs in action.
     
     
    Melbourne-born chef Tobie Puttock, who worked with Oliver in London, heads the restaurant, lending his larrikin Aussie wit and impressive culinary skills to this vibrant establishment.

    The Fire Services Museum was formed in 1972 by a small group of people with the aim of preserving Fire Brigade memorabilia for later generations to look back on. The Museum was a nomad society for sometime moving the ever growing collection to larger premises until they were offered permanent residence at the present site. This Museum is one of only a few in the world operating in an original Headquarter Fire Station, being the Eastern Hill Fire station. 
    
     
    
    Two unique features of the building are the Queen Anne architecture and the 52 metre watchtower. The building is on the Victorian Heritage List and has a National Trust Classification. Touring the Museum one will start at the board room with the original d cor and the mural depicting the first decade of the Fire Service. The next room is where the Chief Office spent some of his day while on duty. Around the room are souvenirs presented to retiring officers. 
    
     
    
    The main hub of a fire station is the front station where fire fighters responded to fire calls, here you will see the hand and horse drawn vehicles through to the beautiful brass trimmed early fire engines. The watchroom opened in 1927, this was the main fire control centre and where fire alarms throughout some of the city centre were monitored. 
    
     
    
    The Museums collection includes memorabilia from Fire Services that provide fire coverage throughout Victoria. Including Country Fire Authority and the Department of Sustainability and Environment. Also visit the International room and our memorial area dedicated to those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. 
    
     
    
    Please take the time to visit our souvenir shop before leaving. The museum is ideal for school excursions and tours can be arranged for groups. Vehicles are available for hire.

- :description: Few cities can boast a garden as magnificent as Fitzroy Gardens so close to the city centre. Valued for its historic, aesthetic, architectural, and horticultural significance, the garden is classified by the National Trust and is definitely worth exploring. Originally set aside as a reserve in 1848, the garden is home to the historic Cook's Cottage, presented to the people of Victoria as a gift for the state's centenary in 1934. The cottage was transported from the Yorkshire village of Great Ayton, UK, where Captain James Cook, one of the first Europeans to chart Australia's coast, lived from 1736-45. The cottage's furnishings and garden have been faithfully recreated from the period. Other features of the gardens include the conservatory (1930) that houses magnificent floral displays, a fairy tree carved by writer Ola Cohn, a model Tudor village, as well as an array of statues and fountains.

    Park your car under one of the 75 year-old oaks that gave this estate its name, and drink in the fresh air of the lovely Yarra Valley hill country. Five Oaks Estate has a modest and comfortable cellar door for tasting the wines, and for enjoying the relaxed hospitality of the Zuk family. The Zuks originally come from Canada, and there's an almost North American feel in the buildings and spreading trees that lead to the vineyard. The Cabernet-based reds are particularly worth trying here. Ralph Kyte-Powell

- :description: Melbourne's first public gardens were established on the highest point of land in the city and hosted a signalling station that flagged the arrival of ships in the bay. Also known to early settlers as Burial Hill, the gardens were a pioneer burial site until the establishment of the Melbourne Cemetery in 1853. Today, Flagstaff Gardens feature picnic areas with barbecues, a playground, tennis, netball and volleyball courts and a walking path. The gardens are a popular lunchtime oasis for city workers and are adjacent to the Queen Victoria Market.

    By Day - Flagstaff Hill
     
     
    Flagstaff Hill Maritime Village is a maritime village built around the state heritage Lighthouse precinct on 10 acres, reflecting the rich maritime atmosphere of an 1870's coastal port. Flagstaff Hill is the ideal starting point to discover Warrnambool and the Shipwreck Coast. More than 180 ships have come to grief along the Shipwreck Coast, with much of this tragic history being documented, recounted and recreated at Flagstaff Hill.
     
     
    Experience first hand the perils of early sea travel as you explore the Gravesend Theatre and Great Circle Gallery. The interactive Great Circle Gallery showcases the relics and treasures recovered from Shipwrecks from the region.
     
     
    A key feature of the Great Circle Gallery is the priceless Minton statue, the Loch Ard Peacock. The Loch Ard Peacock was being transported from England to Melbourne aboard the clipper the Loch Ard in 1878 for display at Melbourne's Great International Exhibition of 1880.
     
     
    Permanently housed at Flagstaff Hill in the new Great Circle Gallery, the life-sized Loch Ard Peacock was washed ashore days after its namesake ran aground. Still in its packing case, the only damage to the Peacock was a small chip in the statue's beak.
     
     
    By Night - Shipwrecked
     
     
    An Australian first, 'Shipwrecked' is a theatrical experience that brings to life the tragic story of the Loch Ard disaster in a uniquely entertaining presentation. The multi-million dollar Sound and Laser show captures the tragedy, drama and excitement of sailing the high seas as an early settler. From within the Wharf Theatre you will be captivated by the multi-sensory experience that unfolds.

    Get active at 'The Action Zone' at WaterfrontCity, located in the the heart of the Docklands, Melbourne 
    
     
    
    The Action Zone consists of the latest in action adventure amusements. Most of these high action family activities are based on new advancements in inflatable technology we call Krush KushioNZ. Krush KushioNZ are inflatable stunt bags that can absorb the impact of a human fall without inflicting injury.The activities currently in the Action Zone are:
     
     
    NEW- The Super Swing 
    
    This Single Trapeze will have you shaking at the knees! Swing out from the 4m high platform and feel like you've run away with the circus. Try some acrobatics or simply fall into the safety of our Krush KushioNZ. Either way it's guaranteed to put a smile on your face. 
    
     
    
    The Base Jump 
    
    Climb the stairs to the 4m high platform and release your inner stunt man as you leap from that burning building (Well, almost). For those who get to the top and wonder 'what was I thinking' there is always the soft option of the slide to get back down to earth. 
    
     
    
    The Face Off 
    
    Standing almost 4m off the ground you must try to maintain your balance as you work your way to the middle of this narrow pole. Oh yeah, once you get there your opponent will be waiting and doing his best to knock your block off! There can be only one left standing! 
    
     
    
    The Rope Walk 
    
    The Rope Walk is a real balancing act that tests your body and mind. If you can block out your fear of heights you may make it to the second platform. Of course before you get to that second platform you have to cross 8m of 40mm rope. Sound easy? Did we mention that the rope is 4m high? 
    
     
    
    The Bungy Trampoline 
    
    Enjoy the weightlessness and acrobatic freedom given to you by bungy cords super charging your trampolining experience.

    The vision for fortyfivedownstairs is to create a versatile, centrally located and affordable platform for visual arts and performance. As a not-for-profit venue, supported by its foundation patrons and sponsors, it has become a mini cultural powerhouse and rapidly established itself as one of Melbourne's most popular and respected venues for music, exhibitions, theatre and intellectual discussion.
     
     
    Theatre director, Ariette Taylor describes the magic of the space as large, light, welcoming, going downstairs to find yourself upstairs. Immaculate, high, white walls, a rough grey floor and the towering window at the end create a space of openness as well as tension. 
     
     
    Every exhibition and theatre production sees fortyfivedownstairs transformed into an exciting new environment.  Hundreds of artists, performers, musicians and volunteers  have exerted an extraordinary amount of energy and emotion over the past five years and it is because of these people, under the curatorial guidance of Mary Lou Jelbart and with the financial support of its patrons that fortyfivedownstairs has become an essential part of Melbourne's rich cultural life.

    The Lee brothers  experience and instinct for food and wine shows in the Foxeys Hangout winery. The stylish, relaxed cellar door occupies an ultra-smart, airy, wood-panelled room with a wall of glass bringing a vista of pines, eucalypts and a cosy little amphitheatre of vines to the doorstep. Quality wine-bar-type snacks slot well with the very good estate wines, and you can even help make your own sparkling wine.    Ralph Kyte-Powell
     
     
    Family-owned winery Foxeys Hangout grows, makes and sells acclaimed cool-climate wines in the beautiful hills of the Mornington Peninsula, just an hour s drive south of Melbourne.
     
     
    Winemaker brothers Michael and Tony Lee are former Melbourne restaurateurs who turned their years of love and knowledge of fine wines into a livelihood when they planted the first of their three small Peninsula vineyards.
     
     
    The brothers personally make the wines and specialise in the Peninsula s flagship varieties, pinot noir and chardonnay, and the region s emerging star, pinot gris.
     
     
    The Foxeys range also features Peninsula shiraz, including a popular and highly rated sparkling version and a vintage port.
     
     
    The Foxeys wines have been well received by some of Australia s most respected critics and the range overall is rated at four and a half stars by wine authority James Halliday.
     
     
    The Foxeys cellar door and kitchen is located at picturesque Red Hill on a historic farming property. Personally staffed by Michael and Tony, it is an intimate but striking architect-designed space with superb valley views over the vineyard.
     
     
    Tony is also a trained chef and serves wine-bar style snacks from the cellar door s open kitchen, while Michael oversees tastings and runs Foxeys  unique customised sparkling bottling sessions.

    The French Island Marine National Park is located about 10 km south of Tooradin, and is adjacent to the northern shoreline of French Island National Park, in Western Port Bay. The park extends approximately 15 km along the northern shore of French Island then the park's northern boundary follows North Arm and the Horseshoe Channel. The entire Marine National Park encompasses approximately 2,800 hectares.
     
     
    The northern shore of French Island has one of the most extensive areas of saltmarsh and mangrove communities in Victoria and the mudflats are of State geomorphological significance. The seagrass beds are nursery areas for fish, including commercially and recreationally important species such as King George Whiting, Bream and Mullet.
     
     
    The area is especially significant as feeding habitat for the 32 species of migratory waders found in Western Port. The waters around Barralier Island, one of the bay's 13 high tide roost sites, are particularly sensitive to disturbance.
     
     
    Precautions 
    
     
    
    For your own safety, only undertake activities appropriate to your skills and abilities. Take all necessary precautions, be aware of changing conditions, and watch for potential hazards, such as rips. A number of Victorian marine animals are potentially harmful if not treated with respect and care, so ensure that you familiarise yourself with these species.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    French Island National Park is a true paradise. Accessible only by 30 minute passenger ferry ride, French Island is a haven of peace and serenity. The 11,100ha park contains environments ranging from mangrove saltmarsh areas to open woodlands and plays home to an equally diverse range of wildlife.
     
     
    French Island supports a large population of the Long-nosed Potoroo, as well as containing the most significant population of koalas in Victoria. The koalas reproduce so successfully that they eat themselves out of house and home. Each year over 200 are transferred to reserves in other parts of Victoria.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Explore the park at leisure by bus or bike or on foot, using the network of public roads and management tracks. There are whole day, half day and shorter walks and rides starting at Tankerton Foreshore Reserve (see the information display at the Ranger Station for guides to routes and more information).
         
    * See a chicory kiln, such as the one at Bayview Chicory Kiln.
         
    * Spot some of the large population of koalas or long-nosed potoroos.
         
    * Enjoy the peace and quiet of an isolated island.
    
     
     
    Accommodation is available on the island, including farm stays and bed & breakfasts.

    Shipwrecks prompted the construction of Gabo Island Lightstation, which was completed in 1862. One of the worst wrecks was Monumental City, on nearby Tullaberga Island, with the loss of 30 lives in 1853. A memorial to those lost still exists on Gabo Island. The light tower is constructed from pink granite, which was cut locally and is one of the tallest and most elegant light towers in Australia.

    The Galli Estate Story 
    
     
    
    Galli Estate was the vision of Tuscan born Lorenzo Galli who came to Australia in the 1950 s.  It was moving full circle for Lorenzo, whose family had made wine in Italy for generations. 
    
     
    
    Two vineyard sites were carefully selected, in the Heathcote and Sunbury wine regions of Victoria.  Each was planted with grape varieties that ideally suited their individual soils and climate. 
    
     
    
    Heathcote 
    
    In 2001 Lorenzo and his wife Pamela developed their 260 acre Heathcote vineyard known as Camelback after the nearby Camel Ranges. 
    
     
    
    The Camelback vineyard features Shiraz, a variety now recognised as producing exceptional wines in Heathcote, along with smaller plantings of two other  Rhone  varieties; Viognier and Grenache.  In keeping with Lorenzo s innovative nature, the balance is planted with less common grapes such as Sangiovese, Tempranillo and Nebbiolo, which all show exciting potential. 
    
     
    
    The Camelback vineyard has a cellar door facility which is open by appointment. 
    
     
    
    Sunbury 
    
    Established in 1997 the Galli Estate Winery occupies 120 acres just 40 minutes northwest of Melbourne CBD.  Along with the vineyard, there is a state of the art winery, cellar door and restaurant. 
    
     
    
    Grapes such as Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, and Sauvignon Blanc grow beautifully here, along with characterful Shiraz, and Cabernet Sauvignon.  Further development is continuing with plantings of some exciting new Italian varietals. 
    
     
    
    Galli Estate Cellar Door & Restaurant 
    
    Galli Estate Winery boasts an impressive Cellar Door & Restaurant complex. The striking steel arched building offers sweeping views over the vines, and is home to one of the best restaurants in the area. 
    
     
    
    The award winning Galli Restaurant offers a range of options including a la carte dining and light lunches in a relaxed vineyard atmosphere.  During the cooler months you can enjoy the warmth of the large open fire.

    Georges, Est 1880: The finest place to shop in Melbourne.
     
     
    Over the last 128 years the finest place to shop in Melbourne has undoubtedly been the store opened by Willie and Harley George the year Ned Kelly died: Georges. After being founded in 1835, by the 1880s, Melbourne had become one of the largest cities in the British Empire and reputedly the richest city in the world thanks to the gold rush. In many ways, Melbourne was the Dubai of the 19th century. And Georges was designed to be the finest place to shop in the wealthiest city in the world. What the George brothers created was a Melbourne institution that until recent times was always a must for shopping for Melbourne's style conscious consumers.
     
     
    A city's institutions are its lifeblood, its soul. For that reason Georges on Collins has been re-opened.
     
     
    Georges has been the preferred choice as proven with fashion openings, art events and exhibitions all choosing to launch right in the heart of Melbourne.

    Giant Steps / Innocent Bystander is an independent Yarra Valley based winery owned by Phil Sexton. Phil has had a long career in brewing and winemaking including founding Matilda Bay Brewing, Devils Lair Winery (Margaret River), and co-founding Little Creatures Brewing in Fremantle. In 1996 Phil sold Devils Lair to relocate to the Yarra Valley, where he purchased a beautiful 75-acre, north facing hillside site alongside one of his winegrowing mentors, Yarra Yering. 
    
     
    
    The single vineyard Giant Steps wines represent Phil s passion for restrained, cool climate Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. At the winery, the winemaking team also produce a range of high quality, interesting varietals and blends from nearby vineyards in the Yarra Valley and central Victoria under their Innocent Bystander label. The new cellar door facility opened in September 2006 and features a wood fired pizza oven, small bakery, coffee roaster, beer on tap and more!  
    
     
    
    Giant Steps wines are produced exclusively from grapes grown on single vineyard sites in the Yarra Valley, including the Sexton s own vineyard and a number of long-term contracted and supervised vineyards. The grapes are grown fastidiously in the vineyard and vinified with minimal intervention so that each wine is a faithful expression of site vintage and culture. The focus for Innocent Bystander, released in 2003, is to produce quality, flavour-driven wines from carefully selected vineyards in Australia, concentrating on Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and emerging grape varieties and interesting blends, such as Pinot Gris, Sangiovese and Shiraz Viognier.

    Gippsland Immigration Park Inc is a non-profit incorporated community group dedicated to recognising the contribution immigrants have made to the development of Gippsland.
     
     
    To this end a park was created in Morwell in which the Gippsland Immigration Wall of Recognition was constructed, along with a Community Deck which overlooks Kernot Lake, a children's playground and BBQ facilities. This park is now the location of the annual Gippsland Multicultural Festival.
     
     
    The Committee continues to work to develop the park and look at further ways in which the contribution of immigrants can be celebrated in the community.

    The Gippsland Vehicle Collection provides south east Australia with an outstanding rotating display of interesting vehicles: cars, motor-bikes, machinery, historic vehicles, carriages and auto memorabilia.
     
     
    Located in the very attractive Central Gippsland rural town of Maffra, the Motor Museum is an easy three hour drive from central Melbourne along the excellent Princes Hwy. Or alternate routes can be taken around the coast, through the hills, or even over the big hill, Mt Hotham and the Alpine Way.
     
     
    Maffra has long been a strong motoring centre and boasts a local hill climb track run by the Maffra and District Car Club and a Motocross track run by the Maffra Sale Motorcycle Club.
     
     
    There are so many interesting and unique vehicles to see that we have a rotating theme of display vehicles for four months at a time. Our current feature displays are listed on our website. The vehicles are on loan from private collectors, mostly in Gippsland.
     
     
    The massive building of around 2200 square metres was built during WW2 as a vegetable dehydrating plant to provide vegetables to our troops overseas, and has been several other factories and warehouses since then, finally falling into disrepair around 15 years ago.
     
     
    The very first donation to the new museum was the 110 year old 'Maffra Spectator', Double Royal printing press. This 5.5 tonne, belt driven machine is now proudly displayed in our Motor Museum along with other antique printing presses and equipment as a most important part of Maffra's heritage. 
    
     
    
    Bus tours and school group are welcomed and catered for.

Mystic Park Brut is the popular sparkler here; there is also Chardonnay aged in German oak; a light but gamey Pinot Noir; and a finely spiced Gewurztraminer.

    Glenmaggie Wines aim to make wine from fruit grown in our own vineyards so we have full control of the wine making process from vine to bottle. We believe that great wine is grown in the vineyard first and best made simply in the winery later with only minimal interventions such as filtering and preservative additions. 
    
     
    
    Celebrate your occasion at a venue with charm and difference. We can cater for any kind of gathering between 20-80 people in this exclusive venue. Winemakers, Tony and Fleur Dawkins offer private dining within the distinctive circular mud brick cathedral ceiling room, alfresco overlooking the mountains and Macalister River or winter dining around the fire. Glenmaggie award winning cool climate wines will complement a menu that can range from a simple fare, to the more intricate - focusing on local produce, you choose. 
    
     
    
    We are passionate about our vines and our wines, but with a history of nursing, dance, youth work, building and most recently dairy farming and parenthood we hope you will find us down to earth and generous with our time. 
    
     
    
    Our first foray into the wine show scene has been a great success with three shows entered and five medals won for our 2004 reds. Winewise awarded our Carbernet Sauvignoon 2004 a Silver Medal and said of the wine that it was A beautifully textured varietal red, with a little bit of leafiness. The Palate is the strong point, offering persistent red and blackcurrant flavour and very fine tannins. This sort of peer recognition is very rewarding and confirms that we are headed down the right track.

    Since the goldfields in the 1850's to the present day, Chinese heritage has been an integral part of Bendigo's history. 
     
     
    Opened in 1991, the Golden Dragon Museum aims to collect, preserve and care for materials of historical significance to the Chinese community, particularly items relevant to the goldfields region of Victoria.
     
     
    Unique to the museum's collection and on permanent display are Loong and Sun Loong, the world's oldest and longest imperial dragon, along with their accompanying processional regalia. This living collection is used annually in the Bendigo Easter Procession. 
     
     
    Situated beside the Golden Dragon Museum, and designed to resemble the gardens in Beijing's famed Imperial Palace, are the serene and intimate settings of the Classical Chinese Garden.

    Goulburn Terrace is one of the smaller boutique vineyards in the Nagambie region. Dedicated to remaining small, and concentrating on high quality rather than volume, the wines are elegant in style. Shiraz, the longtime staple of the region, is made here into a less powerful, more aromatic wine than the bigger Central Victorian types. The Cellar Door is conveniently situated in Nagambie's historic old grocery store in the main street. Ralph Kyte-Powell

    Constructed during the 1880s near Whitfield in north east Victoria's beautiful King Valley, the Gracebrook Vineyard Stables have been at the heart of the property for more than 110 years. 
    
     
    
    The gracious old stables was originally built from local stringybark and red and yellow box round timbers, using traditional bush carpentry methods of the period in its construction.  They were in need of substantial restoration when David and Rhonda Maples purchased the property in 1998 from the Jarrott family who had owned the property continually from settlement of the King Valley. During the next two years, some 75 acres of vineyards were established on the property. 
    
     
    
    The now fully restored Stables are the centrepiece of the property. With magnificent views along the King Valley and across the snow-capped Victorian Alps, the Stables now house an expansive restaurant and tasting area, leading through to the timber deck overlooking the vineyards. 
    
     
    
    Gracebrook wines are a reflection of the passion David and Rhonda have for their vineyards. Each wine produced is carefully managed to maintain the perfect balance between crop load and leaf surface. This ensures optimum quality combined with the unique subtleties of flavour that their cool climate wines have become known for. 
    
     
    
    The winery like many in the region is now producing some classic Italian varieties such as Sangiovese, Pinot Grigio and Dolcetto. These Mediterranean style wines compliment their Albarino, Riesling, Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz wines. 
    
     
    
    Visitors are welcome to enjoy the atmosphere and character the stables provide for Gracebrook Vineyards and the King Valley. The cellar door features light lunches and wine tastings. Displays of art and antique farm equipment should pique the interest of art and history buffs visiting the region.

    Perched atop the spectacular boulder strewn slopes of the Great Dividing Range in Central Victoria, on the infamous Burke and Wills Track, Baynton, midway between Mt Macedon and Heathcote - the Granite Hills vineyard immediately gives you the impression of something quite special.
     
     
    Just 80 Km north of Melbourne (via Lancefield) and with an elevation of 550 Meters, this site is essentially cool, particularly at night, yet with the advantage of being on the northern face of the Dividing Range, the climate here is moderated by a dry and warming air from central Victoria, allowing mid term varieties to ripen. With the additional attributes of a reliable rainfall, freely drained soils and low disease pressure, this site is blessed with the natural ingredients' to grow sustainable premium quality grapes.
     
     
    For over 30 vintages, Granite Hills has been home to an Australian benchmark Riesling, as well as being heralded as the birthplace of the classic peppery Shiraz, first release in 1978. In fact since the first plantings in 1970, Granite Hills has forged an enviable reputation as one of the countries most prized small family wineries by winning more than 400 awards from local and international shows.
     
     
    As pioneers of Cool climate wines, the Knight family and dedicated staff, continue their relentless pursuit to produce the best through attentive vineyard management including hand pruning, crop thinning and hand picking, followed by an astute mix of modern and traditional winemaking techniques, to create wines with distinctive varietal and regional expression.

    Established in 1998, Granite Range Estate produces full bodied wines that are characteristic of the Glenrowan wine region. Since the first vintage in 2000, Granite Range Estate has consistently produced medal winning quality wines.
     
     
    Granite Range Estate is a small vineyard, Cellar Door and Bed and Breakfast nestled on the eastern side of the Warby Ranges, minutes from Glenrowan, the town made famous by the Bushranger Ned Kelly. The area is the gateway to the Gourmet Region of Milawa, the Wine Regions of the King Valley, Glenrowan & Rutherglen, the historic towns of Beechworth and Eldorado and the Victorian Alpine resorts.
     
     
    The Granite Range Estate varietals of Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot and Shiraz deliver flavour and depth of character that makes the Glenrowan region distinctive to North East Victoria and around Australia. The well sited vineyard is characterised by deep granite soils providing exceptional conditions for vine root development resulting in outstanding fruit quality.
     
     
    Anyone interested in the processes of viticulture or wine making is welcome to a walk-through of the vines and winemaking facilities and to ask as many questions they can. Throw Tim a bone and he ll hold back no secrets (well, almost no secrets)   from pruning, vine health and growth to the methods of fruit testing and the bare-bone mechanics of winemaking. Take a private tour through the barrel room and be one of the few people to sample an unreleased vintage. Not many wineries offer this level of intimacy with the wine but, at Granite Range Estate, it s all about getting up close and personal.

    The Great Alpine Gallery opened in October 1998 by artists living in the Omeo and Swifts Creek area of East Gippsland. The Gallery is the home of masterpieces created by local people whom are inspired by the beauty of their surrounds. Paintings, woodwork, craft, photography, sculpture are all featured.
     
     
    Their aim was to establish a permanent exhibiting venue where work could be displayed and sold locally.  Also to encourage greater creativity, to promote the diverse range of artistic talent of the area, and to foster these unique skills inspired by our beautiful environment for the benefit of the whole community. 
     
     
    The Great Alpine Gallery is situated on the Great Alpine Road at Swifts Creek.  From Bairnsdale you take the highway north alongside the picturesque Tambo River, or from Bright the highway winds up to Mt Hotham and down through the beautiful Omeo Region High Country including Swifts Creek. 
     
     
    The Gallery is registered as a not for profit organization and is staffed entirely by volunteers.

    This park represents all that is special about the Otways: the tall wet forests, ancient rainforests, the drier forests of the inland slopes and the very diverse heathlands and woodlands, fringed by a spectacularly rugged coastline and studded with some of Victoria's most striking waterfalls and other attractions.
     
     
    Things to do
     
     
    Walking 
    
    The Great Ocean Walk, stretches 91 kms from the idyllic resort town of Apollo Bay to Glenample Homestead (adjacent to the 12 Apostles). It passes through the National Park and overlooks the Marine National Park. The walk has been designed so that walkers can 'step on and step off' the trail at a number of places, completing short, day or overnight hikes.  
    
     
    
    Horse riding and mountain biking 
    
    Experience and enjoy the natural environment on horse back or on a mountain bike. A permit is required for horse riders to ride in the National Park and Parks Victoria staff can assist you with this. The formed roads and tracks provide ideal trails for these active endeavours.
     
     
    The 12km mountain bike loop linking West Barwon Reservoir and Lake Elizabeth is suitable for mountain bikers with moderate levels of fitness and experience.
     
     
    Picnicking and Camping 
    
    Picnic opportunities abound, with lovely settings at many of the waterfalls as well as Blanket Leaf, Sheoak, Distillery Creek, Moggs Creek, Paradise, Melba Gully, Shelly Beach, Triplet Falls and Blanket Bay to name a few.
     
     
    There are excellent camping opportunities throughout the Parks. Whether you are looking for a family friendly place to park your caravan or a solitary night under the stars there's something to cater to every need.

    Gulf Station is one of the pioneer farms of the Yarra Valley. Its buildings date from the 1850 s and are the most complete group of solid, timber slab farm buildings surviving in Victoria.
     
     
    The original cottage garden has been restored using available records and personal accounts, and has many surviving plants such as roses, lilacs, mulberry and japonica.
     
     
    The homestead and farm buildings, together with the farm tools, the household utensils, farm animals and cottage garden, give a vivid picture of 19th century farm life.
     
     
    Gulf station was temporarily closed in early 2009 due to surrounding land damage caused by Black Saturday and the 2009 Victorian Bushfires.

    Imagine life during Ararat's earliest beginnings and the excitement of the Chinese immigrants who discovered one of the world's richest shallow alluvial goldfields.
     
     
    The world class Gum San Chinese Heritage Centre tells the story of miners from Southern China and brings to life the social, environmental and political situations of immigrant miners in the mid 1800's. Take you own journey and relive the experience of Chinese gold prospectors on their great trek from Robe, South Australia to the Victorian Goldfields.
     
     
    The series of exhibition spaces, state of the art presentations, and rotating displays of Chinese artefacts and period pieces delivers a snapshot of the rich colour and history of the Chinese culture from the 1800's to modern day.
     
     
    A true experience for visitors of all ages. Discover the fun and delight of gold panning, and relive the goldfields way of life. Try your hand at calligraphy, learn about the Chinese language, and view the relics and life-like sculptured characters and authentic artefacts. Involve yourself in the language and story telling room, and admire the mining tunnel uncovered during construction.
     
     
    On a May day in 1857, 700 Chinese miners from Southern China, travelling overland from the Port of Robe, South Australia, to the Central Victorian Goldfields, rested at a place at the foothills of the Great Dividing Range, 400 kilometres due east of Robe. Replenishing their water supplies at a spring, they discovered by chance the Canton Lead, the world's richest shallow alluvial goldfield that stretched five kilometres at length. This find marked the beginning of the Ararat Goldfield, which grew to a population of more than 30,000 in a few weeks. In the first three months of mining, the Canton Lead yielded more than three tonnes of gold.

    Never Ridden? No Problem! No experience is necessary and you can enjoy an exciting horse ride along a beautiful and spectacular ocean beach. A once in a lifetime opportunity for those who have never ridden before. 
    
     
    
    We cater for both novice and experienced riders and have beautifully prepared trail horses to help make this a memorable ride for you and your friends. Note we have customer weight restrictions around 95 - 100kg, 200 -220 pounds or 14-15 stone. If you are in these weight ranges, please ring for details before booking. 
    
     
    
    Our rides include: 
    
    A one hour Bush Ride along a sandy bush track. The horses walk and trot only. 
    
     
    
    Our most popular two hour Beach & Bush ride. Includes a 40 minute ride to the beach, a trek over sand dunes to the spectacular St Andrews Ocean Beach and approximately 20 minutes travelling along the beach. The views are breathtaking and this is one reason why this is our most popular ride. Walk along the crashing waves. More competent riders can generally enjoy a canter along the beach. The horses may even paddle in the water while you take some pictures of this wonderful experience. 
    
     
    
    For the more experienced riders we have our three hour Bush Ride through Green's Bush, a Victorian State Forest where riders will have opportunities to trot and canter along the sandy tracks that thread throughout the forest.

    Hamilton Art Gallery, one of the finest galleries in Australia, is famous for its outstanding international collections of fine and decorative arts.
    
     
    * The fabulous Shaw Bequest featuring 800 items of exquisite English and European silver, glass, porcelain, miniatures and oriental ceramics reflects the collecting interests of Herbert and May Shaw of 'Kiama' near Hamilton. This generous bequest made in 1957 was the beginnings of a collection that is today vast, fascinating, diverse and unique. 
    
     
    * The Gaussen collection of paintings by Paul Sandby (1731-1809), considered to be the father of English watercolour, is unrivalled in Australia and second to the Queen's collection. Still in their original frames they are beautifully displayed in an elegant recreation of an English drawing room with William Morris wallpaper. 
    
     
    * Indian and Nepalese artefacts and outstanding oriental ceramics from the major dynasties are on permanent display in the Barber Gallery. 
    
     
    * Australian paintings include important colonial art of the Western District by Louis Buvelot, 'Wannon Falls', Thomas Clark, 'Muntham' and Nicholas Chevalier, 'Mt Abrupt' painted soon after pastoral settlement. Recent artists represented include Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd, Justin O'Brien, John Olsen, Tim Storrier, Howard Arkley, Tim Maguire and Kathleen Petyarre. 
    
     
    * William Hogarth (1697-1764) is represented in our extensive print collection by his well known satirical suites of amusing moral tales. 
    
     
    * Forty years on the collection has grown to over 7500 objects through acquisitions and gifts and includes fine international examples of 19th and 20th century decorative arts and a growing collection of Australian art. 
    
     
    * Hamilton is an important cultural and education centre. The Gallery's unique collection offers a stimulating experience for all visitors and is an excellent resource for students of art and history.  The permanent collection is complemented with a program of temporary exhibitions.

    Hattah-Kulkyne National Park protects an area of 48,000 hectares 580 kilometres north-west of Melbourne. It lies in typical mallee country with extensive low scrub and open native pine woodland. Superbly adapted birds, animals and vegetation thrive in the poor, sandy soils and searing summers.
     
     
    Hattah-Kulkyne is special because of the flow of permanent water in the nearby Murray River and the freshwater Hattah Lakes seasonally filled by creeks connected to the Murray which provide food and shelter for waterbirds and fish. These lakes can remain full for up to ten years without flooding, but flooding generally occurs, on average, once every two years.
     
     
    Things to do 
    
     
    
    Activities include camping, canoeing, bicycle riding, nature study, photography, fishing and driving (Hattah and Kulkyne nature drives - many other tracks are sandy or impassable after rain).
     
     
    Information about walking tracks, and about the park's natural history and cultural heritage, is available at the Park Visitor Centre. 
    
     
    
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Not many country towns can boast a winery in the main street, but at Heathcote it's a part of the scenery.
     
     
    Situated in the old Thomas Craven Heathcote Stores ca.1854, the cellar door has been revamped in the original Victorian style, and now hosts an art gallery as well. The wines are good and some are perhaps more European in style than other Heathcote offerings.
     
     
    The flagship Curagee Shiraz boasts a little white Viognier to add fragrance and complexity. While the other Shiraz reds are more conventional they drink well, and whites from Chardonnay and straight Viognier are worth trying.    Ralph Kyte-Powell

    Truly great wine results from a partnership between the land and the people who nurture it.
     
     
    Helen's Hill Estate is a family-owned vineyard. The 5th generation to farm, the Nalder and McIntosh siblings and their families are passionate about producing wines of exceptional quality. Loyal customers and a rack of awards say they're on the right track.
     
     
    Helen's Hill comprises the old block, planted to Chardonnay and Pinot Noir varieties, and the new block, planted to similar varieties, plus Shiraz, Merlot, Cab Sav and Sauvignon Blanc. They've also planted some new-fangled and old-but-lesser-known varieties such as Arnies and Viognier.
     
     
    It's the fruit from the old block vines (planted in the early 1980's, making them among the oldest in the valley) with which Helen's Hill makes it classic cool climate varieties.
     
     
    Helen's Hill follows Old World wine-making traditions, adding the benefits of New World conditions and trends to make a better wine. They produce classic wines, steeped in hundreds of years of history, along side some funky new ones - for example a Shiraz Viognier blend, Evolution (a barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc), their hall mark Cabernet blend and a host of others.
     
     
    These wines are available primarily at the cellar door, so invest some time in yourself and check them out. (Helen's Hill also has a wine club, with member perks such as wine maker functions, access to limited releases, product discounts and winery tours.)
     
     
    Just up the hill from the cellar door is Vines Restaurant - heaven for the senses. Stunning views from the architecturally designed building are the perfect backdrop for the modern, elegant dishes, created from fresh, local Yarra Valley ingredients.
     
     
    Create special weddings and superb functions with Vines staff - inside or in the flat, manicured gardens.
     
     
    Private dining rooms and gourmet barbecue facilities are also available.

    Hepburn Regional Park is nestled around the famous mineral springs townships of Daylesford, Hepburn and Hepburn Springs. The Park contains natural mineral springs and significant relics of the gold mining era, all set in delightful bush surroundings.
     
     
    Things to do
     
     
    Tipperary Walking Track  
    
    Runs from picturesque Lake Daylesford to the Hepburn Mineral Springs Reserve, following Sailors Creek and Spring Creek through foothill forest for most of the way. The 16 kilometre track takes approximately five to six hours, is mostly level to gently undulating and is quite easy walking. When you arrive, try the fresh local mineral water from the pump at the Reserve.
     
     
    The Blowhole  
    
    This artificial diversion tunnel on Sailors Creek was built by gold miners, probably in the early 1870s. A hole through the spur was cut to redirect the water flow from the original creek line. The soil in the dry creek bed was then sluiced for gold. It is an impressive sight when the creek is in full flow.
     
     
    Mount Franklin  
    
    Mount Franklin, or Lalgambook as it was known by the Jajowurrong, is located 8 km north of Daylesford, 2 km off the Midland Highway (Daylesford-Castlemaine Road). The sheltered extinct volcanic crater of Mount Franklin provides ideal surroundings for a picnic or short term camping. Panoramic views can be obtained from the summit and there is a scenic walking track along the rim of the crater.
     
     
    Mountain Bikes and Horse Riding  
    
    Many opportunities exist for exploring the Park with a network of old mining and logging tracks providing riders with many challenges in a great forest setting.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Her Majesty's is one of Australia's most historic theatres, and one of the busiest performing arts centres in regional Victoria. It opened in 1875 and is the oldest purpose-built theatre building in Australia to have been continuously used as a live theatre venue. The building is a fascinating mix of old and new, with a beautifully renovated 959 seat, double-balconied auditorium which offers both comfort and elegance, while boasting state of the art lighting, sound and safety equipment. 
     
     
    The Theatre offers an annual Season of touring professional theatre productions, representing a selection of performances from some of Australia's leading theatre companies. 
     
     
    The Theatre is hired by commercial entrepreneurs for tours by popular artists. It is also a community facility and is hired by local amateur companies and groups for the presentation of their productions, including musical comedies, school concerts and ballet recitals. Since 1965, Australia's largest and longest-running eisteddfod, the Royal South Street Competitions, have called the Theatre home and occupy the building between mid-August and early November every year. 
     
     
    The Theatre also houses a 1937 Compton Theatre Organ and boasts many interesting artefacts. The Long Room Bar, overlooking Lydiard Street, is the theatre's gracious licensed bar. Tours of the theatre are popular with groups but need to be pre-arranged.
     
     
    Her Majesty's Theatre has been owned and operated as a business unit of the City of Ballarat since 1990. Today around 300 performances are presented each year, to audiences of more than 70,000 people. Tickets are sold through MajesTix, the Theatre Box Office, and information is available on the Theatre's website.

    Accessible only by boat, Herring Island, 3.2 hectares in size, is just 3 km from the city, and the only substantial island in the Yarra River. This informal parkland has provided the inspiration for curator Maudie Palmer to develop a concept in which artists are commissioned to create site-specific sculptures. Created from natural materials such as stone, earth and wood, the sculptures appear as part of the landscape to reflect the Island's unique and tranquil setting. In particular, different types of stone have been brought from various locations to the island.
     
     
    Things to do
     
     
    The Sculpture Park 
    
    Internationally renowned British environmental artist Andy Goldsworthy has created two works - a slate Cairn and a Stone House constructed from Dunkeld sandstone. Four Australian artists have also installed works on Herring Island: John Davis - A Hill, a River, Two Rocks and a Presence, Jill Peck - Steerage, Julie Collins - Audience, Robert James - The Ramp and Torres Strait Islander, Ellen Jose - Tanderrum.
     
     
    Native Wild Garden 
    
    Melbourne horticulturist Iain Shears has designed a Native Wild Garden using patterns and species which occur naturally in temperate grasslands in Victoria. The wild garden starts flowering in early spring.
     
     
    Herring Island Gallery 
    
    With the assistance of The Sidney Myer Fund and the renowned Melbourne based architect Gregory Burgess, the existing 20 year old Scout Hall on the island was renovated and transformed into the Herring Island Gallery. The architect has sensitively integrated this gallery and its walled court yard with the sculptures and native plantings.
     
     
    To access the island, a punt operates on nominated weekends and public holidays. Check the Parks Victoria website for details.

    Hickinbotham is a very famous name in Australian winemaking and Andrew Hickinbotham is the third generation to make a substantial impact in the winemaking world. The wines here are idiosyncratic with highlights being the Chardonnay blended with the little known French variety Aligote and a surprisingly delicious sparkling wine made from strawberries. The cellar door is rustic, quirky and thoroughly inviting - live music, a raging open fire, freshly baked bread and good food make it easy to stay put for a while.

    Holey Plains State Park in East Gippsland covers an area of 10,460ha of mostly banksia-eucalypt open-forests and woodlands growing on a series of low sandy ridges. The park, proclaimed in 1977, protects an extremely high diversity of native flora and abundant wildlife, while providing for bush walking, picnicking, camping and other activities.
     
     
    
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
     
    Picnicking
    
     
     
    Holey Hill is the highest point in the park at 218m. Picnic facilities and toilets are provided here and the fire tower (access to the first landing only) provides extensive views of the park. Other picnic areas can be found at Harriers Swamp, Merriman's Creek and Clear Water Lake.
     
     
    
     
     
    Walking
    
     
     
    Banksia Forest Walking Track (1km - 20 minutes), located near the picnic area at Holey Hill, leads around the northern slopes of the hill. The Long Swamp Walking Track (3.2km - 1.5 hours return) starts near the tower and leads to the largest swamp in the park. A short walking track (1km - 20 minutes) around Harrier's Swamp provides another interesting walk and a good opportunity to listen to frogs and observe life in the swamp. Many of the tracks off Limestone Quarry Road also provide easy walking through some beautiful wildflower areas, particularly in spring.
     
     
    
     
     
    Driving
    
     
     
    A scenic drive can be taken along West Boundary, Long Ridge and Wildflower Track. Grass-trees grow adjacent to another drive along Jacks Track and South Boundary Track to Merriman's Creek Picnic Area. Most tracks are narrow and winding so please drive slowly and use only sign posted tracks.

    Horseshoe Bend Farm is a popular destination for visitors of all ages. During the week it is regularly occupied by young families, play groups, primary schools and older recreation groups.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * See a range of farm animals including pigs, dairy cows, sheep, goats, Clydesdales, donkeys, peacocks, ducks and other bird life
     
    * Come to the Horseshoe Bend Farm Open Day held on third Sunday of each month. Activities include pony rides and craft stalls

    * The farm can be booked for weddings, parties, conferences and other special occasions. Self guided farm tours, pony rides and childrens parties are also available
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    Until 1854 the 26ha property which is now Horseshoe Bend Farm served as the Keilor Village Reserve. This meant it was used for grazing and by any travellers who were passing through the area.
     
     
    From 1854 until the early 1900's the land was subdivided. In the early 1900's William O'Neil Jnr purchased the property and operated it as a dairy farm. After O'Neil's death in the 1930's, the farm was subdivided into smaller lots. These lots passed through the hands of various owners who used them as orchards and market gardens.
     
     
    The 26ha farm passed into public management in 1975.

    Howqua Hills Historic Area is a site of natural beauty where you can rediscover the days of gold mining and settlement in the area as you walk past historic relics from times gone by.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Howqua Greenston. Outcrops of the oldest rocks in the alpine area can be seen along the river. Aborigines prized it for its hardness and used it for stone axes, spearheads and cutting tools.
         
    * Sheepyard Flat. Locals say that after the valley was settled, shepherds yarded sheep on the flat at night keeping the dingoes at bay.
         
    * Tunnel through Tunnel Spur. Built in 1884 to link the Howqua River and a water race, it is about 100 metres long.
         
    * Water race. Cut by hand in 1884 to carry water to the Hanney waterwheel, it is four kilometres long and can be seen above the road from Tunnel Spur to the chimney.
         
    * Brick chimney. Completed in 1884 and used as a smelting furnace. The waterwheel Hanney was erected nearby and powered by water from the race.
         
    * Fry's Hut. Fred Fry built his home in the late 1930s. Fred's life in the Howqua Valley was the basis of Neville Shute's novel 'The Far Country', published in 1950.
         
    * Horse riding is permitted in the Howqua Valley from  November to the 31 May, with horse yards available at Fry's Flat and Tunnel Bend Flat.
         
    * Camping along the Howqua River is one of the major recreational uses of the Howqua Valley. The historic area has a number of camping areas.
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Over the last 200 years people have journeyed from all over the world to re-settle in Australia. Many have come seeking a better life, job opportunities or to escape conflict. The Immigration Museum, located in the heart of the city explores stories of people from all over the world who have migrated to Victoria.
     
     
    Stories are brought to life through contemporary displays of memorabilia, moving images and computer interactives. You'll discover the dreams, achievements and disappointments of individuals and families who settled in Victoria from the 1800s right through to the present day.
     
     
    Climb aboard the 17 metre replica ship and see the cramped steerage-class square-rigger of the 1840s, the luxurious second-class saloon of a 1900s steamer and the cabin of a 1950s ocean liner. Experience first hand the long sea journey many immigrants endured as they travelled to this new land.
     
     
    Occupying Old Customs House, one of Melbourne's finest 19th century buildings, the Museum takes visitors on a journey of discovery, understanding and, for some, of profound remembering.
     
     
    Moving, nostalgic and interactive, the Immigration Museum is a celebration of Victoria's multicultural history.
     
     
    The Immigration Museum is also the starting point for the Golden Mile Heritage Trail, an historic walk that takes in nearly 80 buildings and attractions through the city. Golden Mile guides are available from the Museum Shop.

    Born in a tiny seaside village in Australia, I love painting seascapes especially yachts and underwater coral reef scenes. l work on canvas using acrylics and high gloss finish coats. 
    
     
    
    Galleries around Australia exhibit my work.  You are welcome to commission me to paint a favourite scene - it's a large part of my work.  I've also held many solo exhibitions including exhibition and teaching residencies at Hamilton Island, Great Barrier Reef.
     
     
    My large-scale murals for businesses and individuals are another aspect of my work along with illustrations and logo designs.

    The little promontory, west of the beach at Williamstown, is known as 'The Jawbone'. Fenced off from the rest of the world for over eighty years by a coastal rifle range, this forgotten and unspoilt place is now considered a haven for coastal and marine life right next to Melbourne. 
     
     
    Patches of all marine habitats from northern Port Phillip Bay are packed into this small area. On the west of the promontory, there is saltmarsh and a stand of White Mangroves along the shore, facing offshore areas of fine clayey sand and patches of seagrass. The eastern side has a complete set of rocky environments. There are areas high up on the shore that only occasionally get wet from storm waves and submerged boulders and ledges that lie below the lowest tides. The soft basalt rock has weathered into smaller rocks and pools that support a full range of tidal life. In between the clay and rock lie some small sandy beaches. 
     
     
    The relatively untouched rocky shores support a diverse and abundant range of animal life rarely seen elsewhere in the bay. The presence of large turban shells, limpets and snails is striking. The rock pools boast pretty gardens of green or pink coralline algae. Numerous seastars and crabs inhabit the crevices, while shrimps and small fish dart amongst the weed.
     
     
    Things to Do
     
     
    Snorkel over the reefs and patches of seagrass of the Jawbone Marine Sanctuary and look out for Globe Fish.

    A visit to the Bendigo Joss House (Chinese house of Prayer) provides a glimpse into the Chinese culture and tradition.
     
     
    Significant as the only surviving building of its kind in regional Victoria, it continues to be used as a place of worship. One of Bendigo's original buildings, it is constructed from timber and local handmade bricks and is painted red, the traditional Chinese colour denoting strength and vitality.
     
     
    Victoria was the destination of many migrants during the gold-rush. Chinese were just one of many significant groups of immigrants who brought with them their beliefs, customs and foods.

- :description: Located on the Great Ocean Road 167 kilometres from Melbourne, Kennett River is a great place to see kangaroos, king parrots or to catch sight of a koala in the forest behind the town or at nearby Grey River reserve. Head to the beach, which is patrolled and safe for swimming and a good place for a walk. Look out for a glimpse of dolphin pods and, between July and September, Great Southern Right Whales as they journey past. Walk to waterfalls, drive through the Otway ranges, fish, swim and surf. The caravan park, with the river running through it is a popular place for visitors in summer.

    In 1953 when Eric and Dorothy Leeke purchased land to the North West of Ararat their intention was to build a family home, put down roots and create a semi-rural environment in which they could raise their three sons.
     
     
    Already a successful entrepreneur, Eric s business interests extended from house building to petroleum distribution and from wool farming to motels, however it was his ever growing passion for wine, Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling in particular, that prompted him to establish a small vineyard on the property. Under the watchful eye of Colin Preece, the then winemaker at Seppelt Winery and stickler for detail Eric set to work. It may well have been Eric s land and his money, but Colin was the boss, he had the experience and the expertise and insisted that the job was done his way or not at all. His dictum has paid hansom dividends.   
     
     
    Ever since Eric and  the boys  first planted Riesling and Cabernet Sauvignon vines in 1977, his sons Jim, Peter and David have successfully striven to improve the quality of their fruit year on year. They have now been joined by Peter's daughter Victoria, a graduate in viticulture and business (finance) from La Trobe University in Melbourne to continue the family's passion for wine and pass on a dynamic vineyard to the fourth generation.   
     
     
    Kimbarra vineyard produces eighty to ninety tonnes of fruit annually, much of which is sold to local wineries and is regularly classed  grade A  by them. The grapes are used in the production of their premium and ultra premium wines. However each year we reserve a small quantity of fruit in order that we might continue to indulge our family passion and share it with others.  
     
     
    Why not share our family passion with your friends and family?

    King River Estate was established in 1990 when Colin Knaggs and his son Trevor planted their first five acres of Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay.
     
     
    These days, Trevor is cropping 56 acres and making his own wine including Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino and Barbera to name a few.
     
     
    Trevor prides himself on the continued and increasing quality of his wines which he attributes firstly to the discontinuation of using any type of pesticides or chemicals on the vines, using wild yeast in the fermentation process and in the last few years introducing the use of biodynamic practices.
     
     
    The winery, cellar door and our fully self contained guesthouse (which sleeps nine) is located directly across the road from the beautiful crystal clear flowing water of the King River where you can catch a trout or cod when in season.
     
     
    We look forward to your visit at King River Estate.

    Things to Do
    
         
    * Tracks throughout the park enable you to plan a variety of short and long walks. The Lyrebird Track near the Masons Falls Picnic Area is suitable for people with limited mobility.
         
    * Visit Masons Falls, and the interpretive display in the Visitor Centre (western section).
         
    * Enjoy the wildflowers in spring and the views from the Mount Everard Track in the Jehosaphat Gully (eastern) section.
         
    * Walk to Wombelano Falls in the Wombelano-Andrews Hill (northern) section.
    
     
     
    Masons Falls Picnic Area
     
     
    There is a designated accessible walk from the Masons Falls picnic area. It is a 500m sealed nature trail called the Lyrebird Walk. Lyrebirds are present in this area. The track has seating at regular intervals and is maintained by two volunteer groups. The track to the Falls is of a high standard and free of steps, but does have some steep sections. The picnic site is quite rough and sloping.
     
     
    Jehosaphat Gully
     
     
    Jehosaphat Gully picnic area has a sealed car park and a good standard of picnic furniture, barbecues and shelter. Gravel paths allow movement around the picnic area. There are only a few steep sections. The designated accessible toilet does not meet current access standards. There is a short circuit walk through the forest. It is only an informal path at this stage, and not designed for accessibility.
     
     
    The Gums
     
     
    A nature circuit walk from this site has a good flat and wide path, generally accessible to all abilities. Camp sites are flat, bare-earth under a tree canopy, and paths to the facilities are gravel.
     
     
    Precautions
    
         
    * Take warm clothing when walking in winter as it can be very cold and even snow.
         
    * Carry water and wear a hat on summer walks. 
         
    * Check the Parks Victoria website for path closures.

    Kingston Heath is one of the Golf Clubs of the world famous Melbourne Sandbelt and has hosted numerous national championships including nine Australian Opens. The Club is the host of the 2009 Australian Masters. The course is currently ranked *27 in the world and *11 outside of the United States and is regarded by many, including some of the world's best golfers, as one of Australia's finest golf courses.
     
     
    We play a lot of unbelievable courses on the PGA Tour, but Kingston Heath would be far and away the best of the regular tournament courses - that's not including the Majors. The US Open has stunning courses, but overall, most of the American courses are nowhere near as good as Kingston Heath. Geoff Ogilvy
     
     
    'Kingston Heath is the pick of the Melbourne Sandbelt courses and I haven't seen anything better around the world. Peter Senior
     
     
    Kingston Heath is one of the smallest courses of world renown. The difficulty of the course is centred around its bunkering, which is visually stunning. It is full of all the strategic interest golfers expect of a fine course.
     
     
    A hugely long course at over 6800 yards when it opened, it is now on the short side of what is regarded as 'championship' length but its genius is that it can still defend itself against the finest players. More importantly, it is a course to constantly stimulate and challenge those who play it with regularity.

    Koomba Park is the most northern of the parks which comprise the Dandenong Valley Parklands. It was opened in December 1981 and extends for 33 hectares between Boronia Road and Mountain Highway.
     
     
    Things to see and do
     
     
    Barbecues and picnics
     
     
    Enjoy a barbecue or picnic at the recently redeveloped Koomba South Picnic Area (entrance via Mountain Highway).
     
     
    Trails and paths
     
     
    The Dandenong Creek trail wanders through the park taking in the beautiful landscape, which includes a variety of plants remaining from the days when parts of Koomba Park were used as orchards. Some of the plants you will be likely to find are Apple-tree-suckers, Elm, Hawthorn, mint plants, as well as a vast array of native plants.
     
     
    Take in the abundant wildlife which live in Koomba Park's billabongs. Billabongs are sections of a creek or other waterway, which are no longer connected as a result of the creek changing its course. It is obvious from the number of billabongs around Koomba Park that the Dandenong Creek has changed course many times.
     
     
    Sit back for a while and try your expertise at identifying birds or recognising frog calls. There's even a jetty to make access easier.
     
     
    In June 1997, 880m of board walk was completed. This filled the missing link to the Dandenong Creek Trail by heading south from Burwood Highway and crossing over the Dandenong creek to Jells Park. This trail is ideal for a variety of activities such as walking, cycling and jogging and is a very important link in the trail network for the Dandenong Valley Parklands.
     
     
    Group visits
     
     
    Large groups and schools are welcome to visit the park at any time. Koomba South is an open grassed area and is an ideal venue for a large family outing or group activity.

    In 2003, approximately 10,000 vines were relocated from the Yarra Valley to Clyde to establish the City of Casey s first vineyard, La Fontaine Estate. In September 2003, after countless hours of manual labour, the anxious wait was finally over when the first bud burst. 
     
     
    And just three years later three out of four wines from the first vintage won medals at the 2007 West Gippsland Wine Show. The wines have been winning awards every year since, both at local and state levels, and this year the La Fontaine Estate 2007 Sparkling took out the  Best in Show  at the 2009 West Gippsland Wine Show.
     
     
    In early 2008 the cellar door opened with a 150 seat restaurant, function centre and a prestigious chef. 
     
     
    After only 6 years, La Fontaine Estate has established itself as one of Victoria s premier wineries so please visit and sample some of all La Fontaine Estate has to offer.

    La Trobe's Cottage was Victoria's first Government House. It was the home to Charles Joseph La Trobe, his wife Sophie and their children from 1839 to 1854. He arrived as Superintendent of the Port Phillip district of New South Wales and became Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria in 1851.
     
     
    The cottage has been relocated from its original site at Jolimont but contains many pieces which belonged to La Trobe and his family. 
     
     
    Charles La Trobe was responsible for many of the key cultural aspects of Melbourne - its library, university, museum, hospital and extensive parklands but it was only in 2006 that a statue was erected to acknowledge his legacy. The National Trust celebrated his achievements in 2006 with the Year of La Trobe.
     
     
    The La Trobe Society promotes recognition and understanding of achievements of Charles Joseph La Trobe, Victoria's first Lieutenant-Governor.

    At high water mark, the lake covers 5,850 hectares of the 8,300 hectare park. Ross Lake (470 hectares) and a 2.5 kilometre stretch of Outlet Creek were added to the park in 1991 and some former areas of the park were attached to Wyperfeld National Park.
     
     
    The lake generally fills and empties on a 20-year cycle, the longest dry period on record being 27 years. It last filled in 1974 and held water for 9 years. Outlet Creek has flowed 3 times since 1974 affording nesting sites for water birds over a number of seasons. As the water level fell, the lake bed was invaded by plants taking advantage of the bare ground. Unfortunately, many of the plants best adapted to this colonisation process were introduced weeds, which are difficult to control.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Outlet Creek and the sand dunes north of the lake can be explored on short day walks or longer overnight expeditions. If you intend to walk in the more remote areas of the park, please inform a ranger before setting out. It is too hot in summer for safe, enjoyable walking
     
    * The park is popular for water skiing, fishing, yabbying and boating when water levels are high enough
     
    * Duck hunting is also permitted in accordance with the regulations, for more information about this visit the parks victoria website.
     
    * Camping is permitted in most areas around the lake. Western Beach, Yaapeet Beach and O.T.I.T. are the campsites provided where fireplaces are allowed

    Lake Cooper Estate is a family owned vineyard and winery located at Corop, on the northern end of the Mt Camel Range in the Heathcote wine region.
     
     
    Owners Gerrry and Geraldine McHarg started the vineyard in 1998 and wine production began in 2001. All of the Estate's wines are made from 100% estate grown fruit.
     
     
    The name was chosen as the vineyard overlooks Lake Cooper, which enhanced the view until the lake dried up in 2002. Hence the Dry Lake 2002 vintage. 
     
     
    The brolga was chosen for the label as Lake Cooper is a traditional breeding ground for the native brolga, famous for its stunning courtship dance. Lake Cooper produces an equally stunning range of richly textured wines that proudly proclaim their Heathcote origin.
     
     
    The vineyard area is 30 hectares growing shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, chardonnay and Verdelho. It is managed by Donald Risstrom who also assists with the wine making.
     
     
    The natural style of Lake Cooper wines, made by Peter Kelliher, has rich and ripe flavours. The full body and fine tannins ensure long-lived wines, while the soft, smooth velvety-textured palate means the wines can be enjoyed in their youth.
     
     
    Lake Cooper Estate is also an ideal venue for any social gathering from a casual BBQ to a white wedding. Patrons are able to provide own food or engage outside caterers.
     
     
    A full bar is provided for pre-booked functions.
     
     
    An annual event, A Day on the Hill is held on the 3rd Sunday in October with vintage release, live music, food, local produce and family entertainment.
     
     
    Visitors to the cellar door are welcomed into a friendly family environment and can enjoy the panoramic views while tasting wines from the full Lake Cooper Estate range. 
    Lake Cooper Estate is within 60km of Heathcote, Bendigo, Echuca and Shepparton.

    Lake Eildon National Park is in the northern foothills of Victoria's Central Highlands, 150 km north-east of Melbourne. Situated on the shores of Lake Eildon, the park protects 27,750 hectares of rugged hills with open woodlands through to dense forest. It is very scenic, and offers the opportunity to experience an array of wildlife, natural and historic features and a wide range of recreational activities.
     
     
    Things to do

    Ninety minutes from Melbourne, and just north of Daylesford in central Victoria, Lavandula has space and beautiful vistas. \n\n \n\n\
    At its heart is the golden stone rustica, a cluster of farm buildings constructed by Italians from southern Switzerland who came to look for gold and stayed to farm. The farmhouse is open for viewing each afternoon and gives an immediate sense of Italian rural life in 1860s Victoria. Twenty years ago Carol White restored the buildings creating a European garden and productive farming lifestyle. \n\n \n\n\
    Eat al fresco. The licensed caf\xC3\xA9 explores European cuisine and, in season, sources food from the garden. La Trattoria's seasonal menu ranges from bread and oil, salads and risotto, to baked meats or veg. With beautifully light, home-made lavender scones children can enjoy a glass of lavender lemonade, while parents can treat themselves to a glass of lavender champagne. \n\n \n\n\
    Enjoy the space. Lie on a rug by the creek. Children can explore the garden and find farm animals. Play petanque or climb the hill to the olive grove. In the Barn find select home wares and Lavandula's range of products good for body and soul. \n\n \n\n\
    Lavender is planted as crop art: in winter it's trimmed and sculptural; at Christmas the lavender is in flower and we harvest by hand with sickles through the heat of January. Bunches are hung to dry under every veranda. Our products are made by hand in the Distillery. \n\n \n\n\
    The beautiful garden and La Trattoria are available for small outdoor European-style functions, weddings or birthdays.\n \n \n\
    Lavandula's contemporary accommodation is just nearby at the head of a secret valley. Broad decks, big view, chic three bedrooms, spa tub & shower room, modern kitchen. Relax deeply."

    Lerderderg State Park comprises 14,250 hectares and stretches some 20 kilometres between Bacchus Marsh and Blackwood. Rising in the Great Dividing Range, the Lerderderg River has cut a 300 metre deep gorge through sandstone and slate, almost bisecting the park. The park has a wide variety of vegetation and wildlife and some interesting relics of goldmining.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
         
    * Lerderderg State Park offers a true bush experience. Walking is the best way to get to know the park - there are several tracks for a range of walks from short, easy strolls to strenuous overnight hikes for experienced bushwalkers.
         
    * Other activities include camping, swimming, rock-climbing, fishing and scenic driving, although some tracks may be closed in winter and early spring.
         
    * The river is popular with anglers. Blackfish and Brown Trout are the most commonly caught fish.
    
     
     
    Camping is allowed at O'Brien's Crossing and elsewhere, although there are no facilities.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Lethbridge Wines - a name to watch. 
     
     
    Max Allen, June 2005 
     
     
    At Lethbridge Wines 'Real Wine' is our passion, wines that are produced from fruit off carefully grown vines and made using traditional techniques allowing the true terroir to be expressed. Our philosophy is to practice organic techniques influenced by biodynamic methods to establish a healthy, balanced vineyard. 
     
     
    The cellar door experience that we offer is quite unique. We have done away with the traditional bar and instead prefer to sit down with our visitors at a table and show them our wines in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. We like to be directly involved with our visitors and so it is usually Ray or Maree (owners and winemakers) who will take you through the range of wines providing first hand information on styles and winemaking techniques. We welcome groups (8 people+) and tours. However, to ensure that we can offer you The Lethbridge Experience' we would prefer you to book a time. Often our groups enjoy some special barrels tastings and a behind the scenes winery tour, so if you are interested in this then please mention it when you book a time with us.
     
     
    As our wines are made to be enjoyed with food, we offer a selection of local award winning Meredith Dairy farmhouse cheeses which can be tasted together with our wines. 
     
     
    For those who would like to linger we also offer Meredith cheese platters matched with a flight of wines which can be enjoyed in our outdoor seating area looking onto our heritage rose garden.

- :description: With a backdrop of mountains, including the Dandenong and Yarra Ranges, this 38km trail passes through highly scenic landscapes that follow the Yarra River valley. Built in 1901, the railway line from Warburton once carried produce to Melbourne and delivered tourists to the area on the return trip. Today it is an exciting trail ride or series of short walks. Look out for kangaroos, bird life and spring wildflowers between Lilydale and Mt Evelyn, and butterflies and tree ferns on the way to Wandin. Stop off at the old railway station at Yarra Junction, now a pioneer museum, before taking in the magnificent views of the Central Highlands and Yarra Ranges National Park along the section to Wesburn, where you can relax at the Sam Knott Hotel (licenced 1863). From here it's another 5km to Warburton, a popular retreat and the end of the trail. Cycling the trail takes approximately three hours one way, on a good flat track. Or stop en route at the region's great cafes, pubs, wineries, restaurants and hotels.

    Here in the Little Desert - a desert in name only - you can discover how many species of plants and animals have succeeded, on poor soils with little water, in creating a kind of arid landscape where survival depends on maintaining a delicate balance of natural forces. The best time to visit the park is between late winter and early summer when the temperatures are comfortable and the park is full of blossoms and wildflowers. The eastern block is the most accessible.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Almost 600 km of tracks criss-cross all three blocks of the park, giving access to even the most remote areas near the South Australian border. Most tracks are too sandy for two-wheel drive vehicles and some of the clay surfaces become very boggy after rain. Good signposting makes the park ideal for four-wheel driving.
         
    * One of the best ways to see the Little Desert National Park is on foot. There are three interesting self-guided walks in the eastern block: the Sanctuary nature walk south of Kiata, Stringybark walk south of Nhill on the Gymbowen Road, and at the Dimboola end, a short nature walk to Pomponderoo Hill.
         
    * From the camping ground south of Kiata, walking tracks lead to a variety of places of interest. An area quite different from the rest of the park can be seen by strolling along the banks of the Wimmera River, or on the walking track at Ackle Bend.
         
    * Long distance walkers can tackle all or part of the 84 km Desert Discovery Walk. Options of one to four days duration are possible.
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Long Forest Flora Reserve was established in 1981 to protect this unique bushland.
     
     
    Things to see and do 
    
     
    * The reserve is open to visitors for walking, nature study and bird watching.
     
    * If you are interested in helping look after the reserve contact the Friends of Werribee Gorge and Long Forest, who organise regular working bees, by calling the Parks Victoria Information Centre on 13 1963.
     
    * Walking tracks are the only facilities. Note that fires and camping are not permitted in the reserve.
     
     
    Heritage 
     
     
    Today, mallee vegetation is widespread in Victoria's dry north-west, but some thousands of years ago, during a warmer and drier period, it extended much farther south. Subsequent climatic changes favoured other vegetation such as box and stringybark eucalypts and the Long Forest is now the only naturally occurring mallee south of the Great Dividing Range.
     
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * All plants and animals are protected. Do not disturb or remove them
     
    * Vehicles, dogs, cats and firearms are not permitted in the reserve
     
    * Fires and camping are not permitted
     
    * Take your rubbish with you
     
    * Please keep to designated walking tracks

    From its mining lease at the northern end of the fabulous Cohen Reef, the Long Tunnel Extended Gold Mining Company produced 13.7 tonnes of gold over an operating period of nearly 50 years.  
    
     
    
    In the period 1885 to 1911 the mine was one of Australia's principal reef gold producers, being top Victorian producer in six of those years. From 1920 to 1936 the 'Renown' Mine with very little success. AUD32 Million in Dividends On several occasions the Company topped the annual dividend list for Victorian Reef Miners, the best results being in 1896 and 1897, when dividends were greater than its paid capital. 
    
     
    
    Its dividend of about AUD32 million in present money value amounted to almost 14 times the shareholders' paid capital. 
    
     
    
    The mine's 8.5 kilometres of underground workings extended to a depth of 923 metres below the machinery chamber which in turn is some 150 metres below natural surface. The visitor can see: 
    
     
    
        * The world renowned Cohens Reef exposed in the workings 
    
        * The main adit or tunnel, which from its entrance, extends almost 300 metres to the machinery chamber 
    
        * The underground machinery chamber from which a vertical flue rises 152 metres to the surface and also from which an inclined air shaft 125 metres long was driven out to the far side of the hill 
    
        * Mine Museum 
    
        * Blacksmith's Shop 
    
        * Entrance to Renown Mine

    Eastern Grey Kangaroos are frequently seen in the area and a quiet visitor may also spot platypus playing in the river. Cushioned between the Yarra River and the surrounding slopes, the river flats have been established as the perfect camping retreat.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Enjoy a weekend camping with family or friends by the Yarra River
     
    * Try your luck and throw a fishing line in the Yarra River - bring your own bait and have a fresh meal of fish
     
    * Bring your binoculars to watch the birds along the river banks
     
    * Paint a picture or take photographs of the valley and beautiful river views
     
    * The wide open spaces of Longridge are perfect for creative play, frisbee throwing, ball games or flying kites
     
    * Longridge Campground has a barbecue (wood provided), an information shelter, tables, toilets, hot showers and a canoe ramp into the river. Camping is available for individuals or larger groups of up to 40 people. Bookings are required and camping fees apply.
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    Longridge was taken over by the former Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works in 1977 from the Cameron family. It was utilised for grazing beef cattle. The Cameron family may have named the property after the long ridge running down to the picturesque campsite beside the Yarra River. 
     
     
    Until 1993, the property continued to be used for cattle grazing, rotating stock from the Werribee Treatment Complex. However, since conservation works (including treeplanting) around Longridge Park have increased, the cattle have been removed. 
     
     
    In 1994, Longridge Camp opened to the public as an overnight camping site.

    Bill and Karen Ashby moved from CBD living to the Longview Creek Vineyard in 2003 and following on from the previous owners are continuing to concentrate on growing high quality fruit nurtured by labour intensive viticultural practices which enable them to produce a range of handcrafted single estate wines which reflect the inherent characteristics of the site. They have been assisted in their endeavours by winemaker, Roland Kaval and viticulturist, Simon Glover, who are both notable wine and grape producers in the Daylesford-Macedon region.
     
     
    The wines are wholly estate grown and bottled and are well priced boutique offerings with regular drinking in mind, not just for special occasions.  Our 2004 vintage is now sold out and our 2005 offering includes:
     
     
    Pippin Pinot  - a good value everyday Pinot 
    
    Pinot Noir - fully matured in one and two year old French oak 
    
    Cabernet Franc  - intense colour and flavours, limited cellar door release 
    
    Chardonnay  - 11 months in Hungarian oak - our point of difference 
    
    Chardonnay Unwooded  - from a terrific vintage, big and delicious 
    
    Chenin Blanc - fresh, crisp and fruity, a varietal not seen much in Victoria 
    
    Riesling - austere and clear in style, one to drink now or cellar  
    
    Pippin White - blend of chardonnay/chenin, easy, everyday drinking, not too dry.
     
     
    A warm welcome will be extended to you at the cellar door with an invitation to enjoy a pleasant sojourn in a relaxed vineyard/garden setting which is complemented by lovely views of the Gorge through which the Longview Creek runs and beyond to the Macedon Ranges.
     
     
    Complimentary wine tastings and tastings from a platter comprising local produce.  Cake and coffee always available. Individual luncheon platters to enjoy with a glass of wine can be ordered in advance. Picnic/barbecue facilities.

    A totally different cruising experience!
     
     
    Your cruise includes a 3 hr, 28km cruise.   A scenic cruise bonus will be to sight the Dolphins that frequent the Lake system from around end-April through to December.  During the winter/spring period we often see baby and juvenile dolphins with the mothers and groups (pods); during these times we exercise great care not to harass them.  
     
     
    We will do our best during the cruise to locate pods of dolphin for your visual pleasure but of course they are wild creatures and at times are in areas beyond our view and control, therefore we cannot guarantee sightings.
     
     
    Expert commentary will be given by your skipper Tony, 4th generation seaman and a local character with an inimitable sense of humour and extensive knowledge of the Gippsland Lakes area and its most interesting history.
     
     
    Tea/coffee will be available with freshly baked scones.  We also have a range of beers, wines and soft drink on board at our bar prices.
     
     
    The Lonsdale is great for private functions - whether a corporate or a family occasion - and we'd love to have you on board for your special event.  Call the skipper to discuss your requirements and he'll give you a competitive quote for your charter.

    Lower Glenelg National Park, 27,300 hectares in area, is situated in the south-western corner of Victoria. The Glenelg River is the central feature. Along the last part of its winding 400 kilometre path to the sea the river has carved a spectacular gorge up to 50 metres deep through limestone. River erosion and the action of rainwater have created some remarkable caves.
     
     
    These and the rich variety of bush plants and animals, not to mention activities such as canoeing, fishing and bushwalking, are ample reasons to visit Lower Glenelg National Park.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Visit Princess Margaret Rose Cave. Commercial boat trips run from Nelson to the cave.
         
    * Take a canoe along the river, camping at the various sites provided.
         
    * The Glenelg estuary provides salt water habitat far upstream for a wide range of fish, including mulloway, bream, mullet, salmon trout and estuary perch, making it one of Australia's most popular fishing destinations.
         
    * Visit points of interest such as Jones Lookout, the Bulley Ranges, and the Inkpot.
         
    * The park is criss-crossed by fire trails, which offer short scenic bush walks. The Great South West Walk also passes through the park.
         
    * There are cabins and a camping ground at Princess Margaret Rose Cave (bookings required).
         
    * Camping is also permitted beside the Glenelg River (permits required). 
    
         
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    The Macedon Ranges are famous for their views, native forests, wildlife, historic monuments and, perhaps foremost, their substantial homes and garden flower displays in Spring. At the western end of the range, the 2379 hectare Macedon Regional Park dominates the skyline.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * A weekday visit should begin at the Visitor Information Centre, Nursery Road, Macedon.
         
    * There are a number of scenic drives, including the road to the summit, memorial cross and to Hanging Rock.
         
    * Hanging Rock was the setting for the novel and film Picnic At Hanging Rock and the annual New Year's Day picnic horse races have been held at its racecourse since 1880.
         
    * The towns of Macedon and Mount Macedon are worth exploring for their exotic trees, gracious homes and gardens. Information on guided garden tours is available through the local Tourist Information Centre at Woodend.
         
    * Within Macedon Regional Park there are a number of pleasant, shaded picnic grounds linked by the Macedon Ranges Walking Trail offering short or long walks.
         
    * The recently constructed Forest Eco-tourism trail leads visitors to Sanatorium Lake, named after the former tuberculosis Sanatorium built in 1899, and closed in 1910 after it was destroyed by fire.

    The gallery space is approximately 200 m2, additionally we have an court yard of about 40 m2 for the display of outdoor sculptural works. \n \n \n\
    Exhibitions generally run for four weeks, and six - eight weeks for the annual Christmas show: Anything Goes.\n \n \n\
    Artists like our gallery space, so we haven't found it difficult to find work to display. Our artists generally come from a belt from around Bendigo through to Melbourne.\n \n \n\
    We have the reputation of selling the best coffee, tea and hot chocolate around, (or your money back)!\n \n \n\
    Our shopwindows have several artworks on display; they are eye-catching especially when lit at night.\n \n \n\
    We have run a number of fully catered evening music events: Crakajak, Ricketty Bridge, Peter Hagen with his harpsichord' Tehai, Joan Drago -opera' Liz Frencham and Fred Smith have been featured."

    The Maffra Golf Club is one of the jewels in East Gippsland's golfing crown. Established more than 50 years ago the course is beautifully maintained with mature trees, immaculately grassed fairways and true fast greens which are among the best in country Victoria.
     
     
    The course (Par 72men 6056meters) is quite flat with just a couple of moderate slopes but is no 'pushover' in terms of golfing and requires consistent shots off the tees, the fairways and most importantly on the greens. The clubhouse is available for functions and has a fully licenced bar.
     
     
    For those planning a longer stay, powered caravan sites are also available.  Weekly competitions are held on most days and special yearly events are well spaced through the year so have a look at the club website for more details.

    The Maldon Historic Reserve comprises about 2500 hectares of public land and forest surrounding the historic township of Maldon, Victoria's first notable town. The Reserve was established to protect relics from the gold mining era that gave birth to the township. The Reserve contains large areas of regrowth Box-ironbark forests and grassy woodland which were extensively harvested for the gold mining and farming industries.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Relics of the heady gold mining days survive close to town and can be appreciated by taking a trail on the Mount Alexander Diggings. Traces of abandoned mines, with names like Beehive, Derby Hill, New Chum, Lady Darling and South German, can be discovered scattered amongst the mullock and tailings heaps within easy walking distance of the township.
         
    * Just 2 kilometres south of Maldon, on Parkin's Reef Road, are the ruins of the North British Mine, one of Victoria's most intact collections of historic mining features showing a range of gold extraction techniques. Carman's Tunnel, opposite North British Mine, is an authentic tunnel where guided tours are conducted on weekends and public holidays.
         
    * The rest of the Reserve is dotted with features including shafts, whim platforms, tunnels, dams, mullock heaps, old dray tracks and stone walls.
         
    * Try bushwalking, forest driving and wildflower spotting at Smiths Reef
         
    * Excellent views can be obtained from the fire tower on Mount Tarrengower and from Mount Moorul in the Nuggetty Range
         
    * A good view of the historic township can be seen from Anzac Hill
         
    * Wildflowers are particularly attractive, especially in the heath type forest at Smiths Reef during spring
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    The Bunker Museum at Mallacoota
     
     
    The Museum is a joint initiative of the local branch of the R&SL and the district s historical society. It is aimed at preserving and displaying Mallacoota s unique WWII history in the context of the wider sweep of the local history of the district. It is located in a large concrete bunker which is heritage listed because of its role in WWII.  
    
     
    
    During that conflict, the Bunker was an important part of a chain of defence installations located along the southern and eastern coastline. It was the headquarters of RAAF coastal intelligence activity in the region, and provided the command post co-ordinating defence of shipping passing the south-east corner of the continent. Aerial surveillance was provided by Avro Ansons and by Beaufort aircraft from the adjacent airfield, while Sea Gull flying boats operated from Mallacoota Lake.  
    
     
    
    A radar installation and signal station on nearby Gabo Island provided surface surveillance and communications. This system provided defence against German surface raiders in early years of WWII and subsequently against attacks from Japanese submarines.  
    
     
    
    These installations were operated on a joint service basis with the RAAF s 1 Operational Base Unit operating the Bunker and the Gabo radar site, the Army providing local security from 38 Battalion and the RAN operating the signal station on Gabo Island. 
    
     
    
    The arduous restoration of the 60 year old facility was undertaken by the R&SL with assistance from community and service volunteers. It was opened by the then Governor of Victoria, John Landy in May 2002.Exhibits include displays and artefacts from the WWII period and relics and records of Mallacoota s early pioneers, industries (wattle bark gathering, grazing, fishing) and shipwrecks.  
    
     
    
    Mallacoota was also home to E.J. Brady s writers  camp where some of the noted poets of the time stayed and worked.

    Malthouse Theatre
     
     
    Malthouse Theatre, formerly known as Playbox, is a company dedicated to the development, production and promotion of contemporary Australian Theatre. Malthouse Theatre s task in theatre is to engage broadly and investigate profoundly what it is to be alive, to be human, to be Australian and to be a citizen of the world.
     
     
    Malthouse Theatre is dedicated to building on Playbox Theatre s three decades of leadership in the nation s cultural and imaginative life through recognising, and being alive to, the changing dynamics of theatre and theatre practice in contest with the contemporary imagination.
     
     
    The CUB Malthouse
     
     
    The CUB Malthouse was originally built in 1892 as a brewery and malting works for Castlemaine Breweries. It was subsequently acquired by Carlton and United Breweries, who in 1985 generously donated the site as a new home for Playbox Theatre Company following the fire that destroyed the company s original theatre in Exhibition Street.
     
     
     
    
    The CUB Malthouse offers patrons a relaxed and friendly environment with a choice of three flexible theatres, The Merlyn, The Beckett and the Tower Theatre, as well as rehearsal and function rooms, a bar and caf .
     
     
    For more information on the venue and venue hire enquiries please contact the Facilities and Services Manager on 03 9685 5161.
     
     
    Dinner and drinks
     
     
    Your Malthouse visit can only get better by arriving early for a pre-show dinner special at Blake s Feast, the caf  at The CUB Malthouse. You can also beat the rush at interval and pre-order your drinks or stay and play after the show and enjoy a drink at the bar.
     
     
    Bookshop
     
     
    Located in the foyer of The CUB Malthouse, the Bookshop is open one hour before every performance. It is stocked by Readings Books, Music and Film, and staffed by volunteers.

    A hop, skip and jump south east of Bendigo, Mandurang Valley is a haven for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay lovers in an area otherwise dominated by the mighty Shiraz grape. Wes Vine's careful, thoughtful wine making lets the lovely fruit qualities of his wines speak intelligently and rewardingly. The spicy, minerally Chardonnay shows some class; and the Pinot Noir is a velvety, gently tannic and earthy wine with an enjoyable yet not insubstantial weight and texture. Shiraz and Cabernet are also quite fine. Not to be missed Ben Canaider

    The sandstone reefs that are within the Marine Sanctuary are known as Little Henty Reefs and are about 80 metres offshore from the beach. Both reefs are clearly visible at low tide and at high tide the tops are still visible.
     
     
    Due to the location and configuration of these reefs, a wide variety of microhabitats are present in a very small area. The remote location of these islands has ensured that they are packed with sea-life. A rich intertidal reef lies along the top of the sandstone islands.
     
     
    Things to do
     
     
    The reef offshore from Marengo is a great destination for snorkellers when conditions are suitable. A short swim from the beach, the reef supports extensive beds of bull kelp which in turn host a wide diversity of smaller red and brown algae and a wealth of invertebrate life.
     
     
    The shelter provided on the inside of the reef makes conditions suitable even for beginner snorkellers on a good day. Outside the protection of the reef the exposure to ocean swell creates a more dynamic environment better suited to experienced snorkellers and divers.
     
     
    The sanctuary is only a short drive along the Great Ocean Road from Apollo Bay, where there are full services, including boat launching facilities and a Visitor Information Centre.

    * Most people will first meet the Maribyrnong River at Keilor where a bend almost circles Horseshoe Bend Farm and a wider sweep rings the main Brimbank Park.
     
    * These waters provide good canoeing and three ponding points have been designed to enable children and adults to discover the delights of catching fish with a hand net.
     
    * The park has barbecues, picnic tables and shelters, and a shared cycle/walking path starts in the park and continues on to Footscray.
     
    * Very little remains of the Riverview Teagardens near Canning Reserve. Here the ladies would be brought up the river for an afternoon of dancing and dining.
     
    * An unspoilt section of the river takes a wide sweep around the Department of Defence land with its remains of the Explosive Factory.
     
    * Parklands on either side of the river include Maribyrnong Park and Fairbairn Park where there are boat landings and picnic facilities.
     
    * Pipemakers Park can be reached from the river and is worth a visit. This is the site of a former meat canning works and later a pipe factory, and pamphlets enable visitors to undertake a self guided tour through the historic ruins.
     
    * The river flows past Footscray Park with its Scotchman's Hill from where the famous Melbourne Cup can be glimpsed at Flemington Racecourse on the opposite side of the river.
     
    * Just downstream from Dynon Road Bridge it is possible to board a pleasure boat for a leisurely trip up the river.
     
    * Fishing is popular from jetties and fishing platforms alongside parks and reserves on either side of the river.

    The scenic attraction of the reservoir and European-style gardens has made it one of the most popular parks in Victoria.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Enjoy a picnic or a barbecue while watching the colourful parrots feeding
     
    * Follow the 3 kilometres track through magnificent native bushland from Maroondah to Donnellys Weir Park and watch out for echidnas and Swamp Wallabies
     
    * Photograph the historic Rose Stairway, which is at its best in autumn. Enjoy azaleas and rhododendrons in full bloom in spring
     
    * During the wetter months, experience the awesome force of the water tumbling over the spillway
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    Maroondah Dam was completed in 1927 and the area below the wall landscaped in the early English tradition, creating a different character from that of most of Melbourne's reservoir parks which have concentrated on native trees and plants. Later development saw picnic areas developed with the native bush and the two forms are at once harmonious and interesting. The historic valve house and classical temple-like structure of the outlet tower reinforce the old world element.
     
     
    Vegetation
     
     
    Bush tracks lead through stands of eucalypts and dense undergrowth of native shrubs and grasses. Azaleas and rhododendrons, planted in gardens lining the main entrance road provide a colourful show in spring.
     
     
    Fauna
     
     
    Animals and birds which may be seen include wombats, wallabies, echidnas, lyrebirds, bronzewings, cockatoos, galahs, sacred ibis, king parrots, crimson rosellas, and, in the evenings, brushtail and ringtail possums, sugar and yellow-bellied gliders and tawny frogmouths.

    This 20 acre property was acquired by Jenny Houghton in 1994, for its viticulture potential and as a location for her bed and breakfast cottage. 
     
     
    3 acres was hand planted in 1997 into a light sandy loam. It is ideally situated in the Strathbogie Wine Region right on the border with the Goulburn  Valley.
     
     
    Planting has increased to 6 acres; 2 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon and 4 acres of Shiraz.
     
     
    Strict viticultural policy with pruning, spraying and hand picking has achieved the required low yield per vine. This has consistently produced small berries of intense colour and flavour. 
     
     
    The altitude of 200 metres, combined with the light sandy loam and intensive monitoring, has produced grapes that enable a wine of elegance and complexity to be produced.

    The McCrae Homestead, built in 1844 by Andrew and Georgiana McCrae, is one of Victoria s oldest homesteads.
     
     
    The original timber slab house is a physical reminder of the early pioneering life, using locally available materials and primitive construction techniques.
     
     
    Built to Georgiana s design, it has been refurbished with many original pieces of furniture and paintings brought by the McCrae family from Scotland.
     
     
    Georgiana was an accomplished artist, musician and diarist.
     
     
    Her sketches, housed in the museum beside the original homestead, contain the rare collection of 19th century family heirlooms and artworks.
     
     
    Purchased by the National Trust in 1970, the homestead has been restored in keeping with the McCrae era of 1844-51.

    The true story of the man McIvor remains a mystery. Surveyor? Bushie? Station Overseer? Local pioneer? Whatever the legend, his notoriety named a region, upon which the McIvor Estate vineyard now thrives. Located in southern Heathcote, Victoria, the vines nestle in the sought-after granitic soil amongst dramatic scenery of large granite boulders, majestic rolling hills and imposing gullies that are framed by the Great Dividing Range.
    Owners Gary and Cynthia Harbor have paid close attention to the region s slightly cooler temperate and have planted varietals that prosper under such conditions. Marsanne, roussanne, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, as well as Italian varietals sangiovese and nebbiolo are part of the McIvor Estate offering, as is, of course, shiraz, for which the region is most acclaimed. The Harbor s have produced a regional benchmark example of this variety in their McIvor Estate Shiraz 2005, winner of the coveted Premier s Gold Trophy at the 2007 Royal Melbourne Wine Show. The terrain of the region results in wines of elegance and finesse that reward short to medium term cellaring.
     
     
    With 5.5ha under vine, and 7.5ha of olive groves plus a small herd of Murray Grey breeding cows to keep an eye on things, owners Gary and Cynthia Harbor have modeled their place on an Italian mixed farm, paying homage to Cynthia s Italian heritage. On the weekends, the cellar doors are flung open and the outdoor wood-fired oven gets a workout with home-style pizzas and wet dishes on special occasions. Olive oil is also produced under the McIvor Estate label, and available for purchase in small quantities

    Medhurst Wines is the realisation of the vision of Ross and Robyn Wilson to produce quality cool climate wines from their unique property in the Yarra Valley.  
     
     
    The property represents one of the best vineyard sites and is also of exceptional beauty.
     
     
    The vines are planted to intercept sunshine at the right level for flavour development.  Variety flavours are further enhanced through hand picking the fruit at low yields to ensure only the best fruit is used to make the wine. 
     
     
    The results are wines which express the unique conditions at Medhurst, as individual and beautiful as the property itself.   
     
     
    Wines produced are Chardonnay, Rose, Pinot Noir, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wines continue to receive critical acclaim.  
     
     
    We have just opened a new cellar door which provides wonderful views of the Yarra Valley and its ranges. 
     
     
    We invite you to taste our quality wines in a family friendly setting and to share in our dream. Why not come up and visit us and see what all the fuss is about?

    Melba Gully is someties called the jewel of the Otways, an apt description for a place where glow worms can be seen. This area is one of the wettest places in the state, with an annual rainfall over 2000mm, and plant growth is profile. The gully is a dense rainforest of myrtle beech, blackwood and tree ferns with an understory of low ferns and mosses. The 'Big Tree' is over 300 years old.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
         
    * Madsens Track Nature Walk, which takes about 35 minutes, is a delightful walk and gives a good introduction to the features of the original Otway forest.
         
    * If you have a raincoat, don't let the rain deter you: it brings the rich green colours of the gully to life.
         
    * In holiday periods there are guided night walks to see the glow worms.
    
     
     
    Facilities

    We begin the day with a briefing with your tandem sky dive instructor. This includes what to expect and what you will see on the plane flight to height, in freefall, under canopy and upon landing.  
    
     
    
    The briefing takes approximately 15 minutes. Our tandem jump masters have completed 1000's jumps and are members of the Australian Parachute Federation. Once the briefing is over, it will be time to gear up in preparation for your sky diving experience. You will be given a jumpsuit and your instructor will fit you into a harness.  
    
     
    
    You will walk out to the plane and there you will conduct your practice exits. Once all the ground preparation has been completed, it is time to get in the plane and get ready for take-off!  
    
     
    
    As we leave the airfield, you will be treated to a scenic tour of the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong ranges as well as the city of Melbourne and Port Phillip Bay. 
    
     
    
    Once we reach height, it will be time to prepare you for the jump. The door opens and as you leave the plane, you and your tandem master will accelerate through the air reaching terminal velocity - 220km/h. Freefall feels like riding a cushion of air similar to riding a big wave. In freefall, your senses will be able to take in stunning views as far as the eye can see. Then finally it's time to pull your parachute open. 
    
     
    
    From the loud rushing of air that you hear all around you, the parachute ride is very different as you sail around the sky, gliding. 
    
     
    
    The landing is easy, just lift your legs. The parachute will glide and you will eventually put your feet down to land.

    The Melbourne Steam Traction Engine Club operates a vintage engine museum set in six hectares of parkland in the south eastern suburb of Scoresby. In all there are several hundred engines and related exhibits housed in a number of exhibition sheds around the grounds.
     
     
    Steam exhibits include traction engines, among them a pair of massive Fowler Z7 steam ploughing engines, steam rollers, portable engines and a large and varied collection of industrial and marine stationary steam engines and pumps.
     
     
    There is a period workshop and a diesel engine section. You are unlikely to see a comparable display of large diesel generators elsewhere. The smaller internal combustion engines are also well represented. There are displays of tractors, agricultural equipment and early road working and earth moving machinery.
     
     
    An added attraction for the kids is the miniature railway which operates every Sunday. 
    
    The museum is open for static display each weekend but most of the engines are in running order and on the last Sunday of the month a selection can be seen in operation.
     
     
    Usually steam will be raised in the stationary steam museum and two or three traction engines or steam rollers can be seen out on the arena and the miniature railway is operated by a steam locomotive.
     
     
    The grounds are attractively laid out with a lake, barbecues and shady picnic areas. The 1 kilometre miniature railway track circuits the grounds.

The Yarra Valley, Dandenong Ranges, Phillip Island and the Mornington Peninsula are all easily accessible within two hours' drive of the city on simple self-drive routes that also connect to form the South & East touring route. Head east to the Yarra Valley for more than 55 mainly boutique wineries, fine local produce and the native wildlife of Healesville Sanctuary. Just 30 minutes south of here, the hillside retreat of the Dandenong Ranges is a great spot for a bushwalk among the eucalypt trees, scones and tea at a traditional tearoom, superb rhododendron gardens and of course a journey on Puffing Billy. Journey south from here to Phillip Island, for the remarkable nightly penguin parade, thousands of seals offshore and beautiful surf beaches. Then continue on to the stunning Mornington Peninsula, a Mediterranean-like jewel with sandy bays, upmarket wineries and cafes, strawberry farms and excellent golf courses.  From the peninsula it's just over an hour back to cosmopolitan Melbourne.

    Located a short distance from Melbourne's CBD, Melbourne's Valley of the Arts has long been a region of creative inspiration. The area boasts fabulous art, architecture, parks, gardens, food and wine, and offers visitors the opportunity to discover and experience what has captured the imagination of some of Australia's great artists.  
    
     
    
    It is a historic region with a wide range of influences, having been home to the Wurundjeri Aborigines, the internationally recognized Heidelberg School of Artists, the first European farming settlers outside of Melbourne and the site of Victoria's first gold discovery at Warrandyte. Heide Museum of Modern Art, often described as an incubator for Australian modernism, has a strong association with artists including Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd, Albert Tucker and Joy Hester and remains a major attraction of the Valley of the Arts. Heide's recent redevelopment ensures that it will continue to be a central part of the region's cultural identity.  
    
     
    
    The 1930s architectural masterpiece Monsalvat at Eltham is a series of unique and distinctive buildings in the European style set in over 12 acres of parkland. Montsalvat's galleries, working artists' studios, gardens and Great Hall are well worth visiting during your exploration of the area. The descendants of the Wurundjeri also retain an interest in the area and their tradition lives on in the indigenous art galleries and Aboriginal sites of the region, most notably the Bolin Bolin Billabong.    
    
     
    
    There is always plenty to see and do in the region throughout the year, with festivals, theatre productions, artists open studios, indigenous programs, fruit picking, heritage walking tours, the Heidelberg School Artists' Trail, the Mullum Cultural Heritage Trail, the JA Turner Artist Trail, wineries, galleries and studios all offering a distinct cultural experience. Or just take in the natural heritage of the region's diverse nature reserves, river land parks and gardens.

    Mercato - Italian for market. Respecting the Italian heritage of Daylesford and the proximity of the famous Daylesford Market. In early European history, the town market place was the heart and soul of the town. All walks of life came together to satisfy their needs, from the most basic to the most extravagant.
     
     
    All forms of business were carried out from the administration of justice to the declaration of intention to marry in front of the market cross. The market was a gathering place of people and goods from around the world. Full of vibrant colours, a myriad of smells and tastes, the creative and the unusual, the unique and the necessary, and of course the gossip and intrigue. A contemporary dining experience awaits you in this 1864 timber building.
     
     
    Lovingly restored with polished floor boards, high ceilings and soothing colours Mercato is a well laid out restaurant thanks to owner Richard Mee. You could be seated by one of our three open fire places during the cooler months or outside under the heritage listed trees during the summer enjoying a glass of local wine and sampling the delights of the menu.
     
     
    The creative menu of modern Australian cuisine with regional flavours prepared by Richard Mee and his team produces a sophisticated ensemble of dishes to suit the most discerning of tastes.

    Michael Unwin Wines was established in Ararat, Victoria in 2000 by winemaker Michael Unwin and his business partner, Catherine Clark. The company incorporates its own label, as well as contract winemaking and consulting.
     
     
    Having relocated to Beaufort in May 2004, with a new, purpose-built winery, Michael Unwin Wines has been voted one of the best new top ten wineries by James Halliday - 2004 Edition Wine Companion.
     
     
    Michael Unwin is a winemaker of many years experience and he long cherished a dream to establish a winery that would reflect his love and experience of wine making. The winery's first large scale bottling was the Acrobat Collection; a shiraz, a cabernet sauvignon, a chardonnay and a riesling made from locally grown grapes. With only low-key marketing and sales promotion to date, these wines have earned a fervent local following and strong sales figures.
     
     
    Michael Unwin Wines makes handcrafted, premium wines using locally grown grapes. The Acrobat Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes are grown at the northern most extremity of the Great Dividing Range, below Mount Zero. Acrobat Chardonnay is made from the fruit of 30 year old vines at Great Western and the Riesling is grown in a high altitude vineyard near Moonambel.
     
     
    Experience gained from two decades in this fascinating industry, has enabled Michael to develop a philosophy of wanting to debunk myths and soften the image of winemaking to eradicate the pretension that exists. A winery is a factory is one of Michael's most often quoted statements. Winemaking is basically an industrial process in which the winemaker assists with the natural decomposition of grapes. We create world-class wine by sourcing world-class grapes using natural resources and by being ecologically aware.

    Situated between Mt Buffalo and Devil's Creek in the Buckland Valley, Michelini Wines was established in 1982 by Emo Michelini and his two sons, Ilario and Dino, continuing a family winemaking tradition dating back to 1851. 
    
     
    
    The Merlot is the pride of the Michelini stable, boasting vibrant red colour and violet fruit characters integrated with French oak. Like the Michelini family, Marzemino originates from the Trentino region in northern Italy, and this limited release wine displays deep colour, marzipan and chocolate notes on the nose and savoury finish.  
    
     
    
    Another Italian variety, the Fragolino is made from the strawberry flavoured Fragola grape in a dessert style wine. Ralph Kyte-Powell

    Since establishing Milawa Mustards in 1982, Anna and David Bienvenu have extended their range of home made seeded mustards from five varieties to eighteen. 
    
     
    
    The mustards are handmade on the premises by David and are made using only the finest ingredients grown on their farm, one kilometre out of Milawa. If you are travelling through Milawa in the spring time, the Mustard fields can usually be viewed from the Snow Road just out of town. 
    
     
    
    Since relocating Milawa Mustards from their house on the farm, to the beautiful Old Emu Inn in the centre of Milawa, Anna has launched a whole new range of seasonal condiments, such as pastes, jellies, jams, chutneys, marmalades and salad dressings, again utilising the couples herbs and fruits grown on their farm. 
    
     
    
    Anna and David have successfully retained the cottage industry approach. All of Milawa Mustards condiments are handmade by Anna and David themselves on the premises, thus preserving the quality of this authentic cottage industry by growing, preparing and selling their range of more than 100 different seasonal condiments. 
    
     
    
    With new products being established in the area all the time, Anna and David are continually adding an already impressive range of condiments, whilst only selecting from producers with their same commitment to quality. 
    
     
    
    A newer feature at Milawa Mustards is an ever changing exhibition of limited edition photographs by proprietor Anna Bienvenu. Anna studied photography at Photography Studies College South Melbourne, but after starting the business in 1981, had very little time for anything else. It was the fires of 2003 that finally jolted Anna back into serious photographic action. For the past five years Anna has been concentrating on the effects of fire on several areas in North East Victoria and will be returning each winter to record the changes to the Mt. Buffalo National Park landscape.

    Graeme Miller is a pioneer of the 60s/70s rebirth of the Yarra Valley as a wine region. He established Chateau Yarinya at Dixons Creek in 1971 and was soon drawing attention to the region by winning major wine show awards, including the 1978 Jimmy Watson Trophy. The attention included the De Bortoli family who were looking for a premium cool climate site and in 1987 they purchased the property. Selecting a new site within a kilometre of his original vineyard, Graeme began planting Dixons Creek Estate in 1988. Chosen for its excellent north and north east facing slopes, today it covers 57.5 hectares, with 30.5 hectares under vine.
     
     
    Grape varieties grown include Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris. Graeme made a return to winemaking because of his belief in regional difference and the Yarra Valley as an excellent wine producing area. Graeme and his wife Bernadette opened cellar door at the new site and reflect strong environmental stewardship in the practices in the winery and the vineyard.
     
     
    Millers Dixons Creek Estate produces fine Yarra Valley wines, available through mailing list, online, cellar door, selected retail and on-premise outlets. All wines produced are estate grown, single vineyard, with the exception of a small amount of Cabernet /Franc purchased from a nearby vineyard and used in the Bordeaux-style blend.
     
     
    Graeme is working to produce long-lived wines, not dominated by alcohol, which reflect the depth and complexity he believes the Yarra Valley as a premium, cool climate, wine region can produce.  
    
     
    
    Wines include Sparkling, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Shiraz, Merlot, Cabernet, Quatrain (Bordeaux style blend), Petit Verdot and Vintage Port. 
    
     
    
    Cellar door is open 7 days, offers spectacular views of the valley and overlooks the working winery. Winery tours are available.

    Mitchell River National Park surrounds the spectacular Mitchell River where it passes between high cliffs. There are several gorges, including the Den of Nargun mentioned in Aboriginal Legends. Remnants of temperate rainforest line some of the gorges. The park is 11,900 hectares in size and contains some of Gippsland's best forest country.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
     
    * Canoeing or rafting provides the easiest access to much of the park and there are long walks through the Mitchell River Gorge. The river offers the canoeist short day trips or extended touring through tranquil pools and turbulent rapids down to the Gippsland Lakes. The best time is from July to December.
     
    * The Mitchell River Walking Track follows the west bank of the river downstream from Angusvale through the gorge to the Den of Nargun. This is a two-day walk of 17 km. Half way through the gorge is Billy Goat Bend with a spectacular, semi-circular cliff known as the Amphitheatre.
     
    * It is possible to drive to the car park and picnic ground of the Den of Nargun at the southern end of the park. Steep but well made walking tracks lead to the actual cave.
     
    * Hunting is permitted in accordance with the regulations
     
    * A circuit walk takes in the Bluff Lookout and the Mitchell River.

    The impressive Mitchelton complex by the Goulburn River is in some of Victoria's most historic vineyard country. The winery's successful recent direction has been towards the Rhone varieties, both those traditional to the Goulburn Valley, like Marsanne and Shiraz, and the less familiar like Roussanne, Viognier and Mourvedre. In addition Blackwood Park Riesling remains among Victoria's best, Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are worthy drops too. Mitchelton also boasts an excellent restaurant that uses local produce with flair and skill. A must for visitors to the region. Ralph Kyte-Powell

    Home to one of the finest collections of Australian photography, the Monash Gallery of Art (MGA) also presents an extensive variety of exhibitions, educational programs, talks and special events. Three gallery spaces feature a diverse temporary program of historical, contemporary, local and international exhibitions in photography, fine art, craft and design. 
    
     
    
    An initiative of the City of Monash, the MGA opened in 1990. Boasting a nationally significant collection of Australian photography, the Gallery s permanent collection comprises over 2,000 works illustrating the development and evolution of the photographic medium in Australia. 
    
     
    
    Included in the collection are late 19th century images of exploration and colonial endeavour by Nicholas Caire and Charles Bayliss; works representative of a Pictorialist approach to photography by Harold Cazneaux, J.B. Eaton and Jack Cato; and examples of 20th century Modernism by icons in photography Max Dupain, Olive Cotton and Wolfgang Sievers. The collection also includes strong holdings of documentary photography by David Moore, Jeff Carter, Mark Strizic, Roger Scott, Mervyn Bishop, Robert Whitaker, Rennie Ellis and Bruce Postle. 
    
     
    
    Examples of works by Anne Zahalka, Julie Rrap, Anne Ferran, Patricia Piccinini, Rose Farrell and George Parkin, Destiny Deacon, Tracey Moffatt and Bill Henson reflect the diversity of approach, processes and styles in contemporary photographic practice. 
    
     
    
    The emergence of the new digital photography at the start of the 21st century is exemplified by works in the collection by Pat Brassington, Michael Riley and Charmaine Hardy. 
    
     
    
    The remarkable breadth of MGA s photography collection allows us to reflect on the multiple roles of photography - as a medium of communication and artistic expression, as a documenter of life, and as a medium that occupies a vital and central place in contemporary culture.

    Montsalvat is the first and oldest artist colony built in Australia. Set on 12 acres in Eltham, it consists of a series of unique and distinctive buildings classified by the National Trust, Heritage Victoria and the Australian Heritage Commission. Built in reminiscence of a European provincial village, it stands as a testament to the vision of one man, Justus Jorgensen
     
     
    History
     
     
    Architect-Painter Justus J rgensen bought the land that became Montsalvat in 1934 with the dream of creating a community where the Arts were practiced and nurtured. A student of the controversial Melbourne painter Max Meldrum, Justus inspired his own students with a similar discipline and with their enthusiastic cooperation and loyal support, the creation of Montsalvat began. Justus pioneered the modern day use of mud bricks and the Pis  technique, and recycled materials which he sourced both locally and from city building sites.
     
     
    Today
     
     
    Now the oldest Artists colony in Australia, this national icon is still a working Arts Centre with resident artists and studios, picturesque gardens and unique historic buildings.
     
     
    A 20 minute scenic drive from central Melbourne, a day s activities can involve visiting the Barn Gallery and Long Gallery Exhibitions before enjoying a sumptuous lunch in the Montsalvat Restaurant and courtyard. Spend the afternoon exploring the rest of Montsalvat s grounds and buildings, walking amongst the resident peacocks, geese, and ducks. Take a step back in time and see & touch the life of a true visionary.
     
     
    The Montsalvat annual programmes of events include Sunday music concert series, exhibitions and festivals of food/wine, poetry and theatre.
     
     
    Further Information
     
     
    Montsalvat has an ongoing commitment to nurture and promote the arts through it s many community events. For further general information, or on how to support Montsalvat please go to our web page or call us for further information.

    Mark and Gina Morgan's boutique vineyard and cellar door is located in the picturesque countryside of Lancefield, one hours drive north of Melbourne. The property is set on the southern slopes of the Great Divide with splendid views of Mount Macedon and the Cobaw Ranges on our back door.
     
     
    MorganField produces distinctive cool climate Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon. The earliest plantings of some of these vines were made in 1980 to 1982. Pinot Gris was planted in 2005 and The Sparkling block will be ready for production in 2008. All this increases the vineyard's production capacity to 10 acres (4ha).
     
     
    In 2006 MorganField won gold and the Longfellows Insurance Brokers Trophy for their 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon at the Macedon Ranges Wine Exhibition. Over the past several years they also won bronze medals for their 2004/2005 Pinot Noir and 2005/2006 Unwooded Chardonnay. Silver medal was awarded at the Daylesford Wine Show for their 2005 Wooded Chardonnay and a bronze awarded at the National Cool Climate Show. Halliday awarded this fruit driven wine 94 points in his 2009 Wine Companion.
     
     
    Mark and Gina welcome visitors and group tours (the latter by appointment) to the vineyard for tastings and sales. Their cellar door offers a selection of gourmet platters and pies, a 'specials' menu of the day and fresh coffee/ tea .
     
     
    BBQ facilities are available for the keen cook or book in advance and let Mark and Gina provide a number of food options while you relax in the tranquillity of the countryside.
     
     
    Location is 80km North of Melbourne. Travel along the Tullamarine Freeway, turning right onto the Lancefield/Melbourne Road (just follow the signs to Lancefield/Romsey). Pass the township of Lancefield for 2km and turn left into the Burke and Wills Track, MorganField is only 4kms away.

    The Mornington Railway (MR) is an operating railway museum, which recreates various Victorian Railways branch line activities just as they used to be for the education and enjoyment of the general public. 
     
     
    The MR's longer-term vision is to offer a variety of services representing different methods of branch line operation in use from 1900 until the end of the branch line era in the 1970's. 
     
     
    A feature of the MR is that original Victorian Railways heritage equipment and rollingstock is used to support and operate train services. 
     
     
    The Mornington railway line is a heritage item in itself, having been opened in 1889. The main operational focus of the MR is the running of steam-hauled passenger trains, but original Victorian Railways diesel-electric locomotives are used on trains occasionally. 
     
     
    Consideration is also being given to adding heritage goods vehicles onto regular passenger trains to recreate the era of the mixed train. 
     
     
    Our trains run on a regular basis between Moorooduc and Mornington, a round distance of approximately 9kilometres. 
     
     
    The remaining unrestored 4.5 kilometres section of the line between the main line junction at Baxter and Moorooduc is being restored as time and funds permit. 
     
     
    The MR's main centre of activity is Moorooduc station (Melway 105 K9) conveniently located in the centre of the Mornington Peninsula, a popular holiday destination about 60 kilometres from Melbourne 
     
     
    The MR is operated by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society (MRPS), a not-for-profit incorporated association, which is staffed by dedicated volunteers.

    Although Morris now comes under the rather large umbrella of the Orlando Wyndham group it is still a winery that sticks to its knitting. The very best wines remain the fortifieds and the sherries in particular are among Australia's very best - a seductive Amontillado style is a highlight. The sparkling Shiraz Durif is also a cracker and the varietal Durif one of the region's best. Ben Canaider

    The cellar door at Morrisons of Glenrowan is open daily from 10am to 5pm and Sundays 12pm to 5pm. The vineyard, winery and cellar door of Morrisons of Glenrowan are located just two kilometres from the site of Ned Kelly s last stand, Ann Jones  inn where the siege of Glenrowan occurred.  
    
     
    
    The rocky quarry track wends its way through the vines to the cellar door that is sited on an elevated section of the bush block. Panoramic views are there to surprise you as you arrive at the cellar door. The Morrisons produce fine full bodied red wines that are true to the style and terroir of the Glenrowan Wine Region. Shiraz, Durif, Primitivo, Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon are made and some interesting blends are produced.  
    
     
    
    All wines are aged in barrels of American or French oak. A small amount of cool climate Semillon /Sauvignon Blanc is made each year. The small scale operation has been in production for eight years, and is a retirement project for the Morrisons. Bob and Dianne Morrison studied winemaking at The Centre, Wangaratta in 2001 and Bob Morrison graduated in 2007 with a Diploma of Wine Technology from Melbourne University, Dookie campus.    
    
     
    
    Homemade preserves are available at the Morrisons of Glenrowan Cellar Door. There are homemade jams, worcestershire sauce, pickled walnuts and herbal tea. The work of local print maker Fleur Rendell can be viewed and purchased.

    An association with the Latrobe Council and volunteer Friends of the garden has created three acres of internationally recognized rose garden, set in a park like setting at the edge of  the CBD. 
    
     
    
    Climbing roses create walls of colour and perfume, while below garden paths wend their way through perfumed beds of Hybrid Tea, Floribunda and Austin roses. A collection of Australian and New Zealand bred roses is at the southern end; and to the north set in a cottage garden are many old fashioned and species roses.

    Proclaimed in 1967, Morwell National Park is an area of natural beauty that is also suitable for passive recreational activities. The park has regional significance as one of the few remaining areas of remnant vegetation in the Strzelecki Ranges. This park is best known as a habitat for over 40 species of native orchid.
     
     
    Things to do 
    
    A self-guided nature walk through Fosters Gully provides the visitor with detailed information on the variety of plants and animals found in the park. The walk begins at the Kerry Road picnic area and takes about an hour to complete. Camping is not permitted.
     
     
    Heritage 
    
    Morwell National Park and surrounding area was occupied by the Woollum Woollum Clan who used the area to hunt possums for food and skins. Artefacts from these times have been found in the surrounding areas. Europeans settled here in the 1840s and cleared land for grazing. Remnants of saw mills and mining can be seen today.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Things to see and do
     
     
    Panoramic views can be obtained from lookouts at Lang's Lookout, Dog Rocks and Shepherd's Flat after scrambling over a few rocks.
     
     
    The West Ridge Walking Track of 4 kilometres links all the major lookouts and points of interest. The walk is best started at Lang's Lookout down to Old Koala Park. The entire track can be completed as an enjoyable half-day walk or small sections can be walked during successive visits. Several walking track circuits are provided in the Koala Park.
     
     
    Picnicking is also popular, whether at one of the lookouts and rock outcrops, or at the Koala Park (where there are barbecues, toilets, tables and drinking water). Dispersed camping is permitted throughout the park.
     
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * Obey fire regulations and restrictions (North West Total Fire Ban District)
     
    * Take your rubbish home with you
     
    * Please do not disturb, damage or remove any native plants or animals or historic remains
     
    * Do not attempt to drive off the Mt Alexander Tourist Road
     
    * Keep dogs on a leash
     
    * Leave the park as you find it
     
     
    Precautions
     
     
    Do not attempt to cross perimeter fences surrounding the granite quarries or transmission facilities.

    Mount Arapiles is a spectacular feature, rising sharply from the Wimmera plains to form part of the Mount Arapiles-Tooan State Park. The park includes Mitre Rock, adjacent to Mount Arapiles and the Tooan block. The 5060 hectare park is valuable for nature conservation, with about 14per cent of the State's flora species represented in the Mount Arapiles section alone.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Mount Arapiles, widely regarded as the top rock climbing area in Australia, is of world renown.
         
    * Two short walking tracks link Centenary Park to the summit of Mount Arapiles and the sealed Lookout Road gives easy access to a short walk that leads to the summit. There is also a short but interesting nature walk from Lookout Road.
         
    * The vehicle track which circles the Mount is suitable for cycling and driving and is a good walk in wildflower season. All but the eastern end of the track is closed to vehicles during winter.
         
    * Birdwatching, painting and nature studies are also popular activities.
    
     
     
    The main picnic area and the only location where camping is permitted is Centenary Park, near the base of the cliffs. Backpacker and hotel accommodation is available in Natimuk, and there is a caravan park at Natimuk Lake, 4 km north of the township.

    Distinctive boutique winery, recognised for its ability to combine innovation and tradition. The organic vineyard produces small quantities of flavoursome fruit and all wine is hand-crafted on-site. The honest varietal expression and true terrier character have resulted in a level of quality and consistency not often found among boutique vineyards.
     
     
    Superb Victorian wines, full flavoured, robust and approachable, including a spicy and berried Shiraz, a chocolaty Cabernet and a concentrated black current and plum Merlot. A limited edition Tempranillo is not to be missed.  Mount Avoca's hand crafted Sauvignon Blanc is arguably the best in the Pyrenees with tropical passionfruit notes and a smooth lingering finish.

    Mount Beckworth typifies the hard work and enthusiastic endeavour of many of this region's wineries. Paul Lesock's vineyard to Ballarat's north produces wines that are more than just flavoursome - the unwooded Chardonnay shows clean, fresh fruit and some depth; the Pinot Noir is gamey and savoury; and the Cabernet Merlot is an attractive medium-weight wine. Buy a few extra to see what two or three years' bottle age can do to these wines. Ben Canaider

    An all-seasons park, Mount Buffalo has sheer cliffs, imposing granite tors, tumbling waterfalls, snow gums and stunning wildflowers. First reserved in 1898, the 31,000 hectare park contains vegetation and fauna adapted to extremes of weather, as a result of its sub-alpine location.
     
     
    As you drive and walk throughout the park, you will see evidence of the 2003 and 2006 fires, but you will also see the vivid colours as species continue to regenerate. There is plenty of wildlife to see including lyrebirds, eastern rosellas, wombats and swamp wallabies. Many animals can be seen along the main tourist road so please drive carefully, especially at dawn and dusk.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Explore the network of walking tracks that lead to waterfalls, lookouts and granite formations. 
         
    * Take in the spectacular views of the Australian Alps.
         
    * Camp at Lake Catani and enjoy swimming or canoeing.
         
    * In winter, Mt Buffalo is often called the family mountain because of its visitor-friendly atmosphere. The park offers safe and accessible cross-country skiing, tobogganing and snow play.  
         
    * The adventurous can try hang gliding or rock climbing. Buffalo is a top Australian venue for both. Parks Victoria has installed a Rockclimbing/Abseiling Intentions Book at the information shelter in the Gorge carpark
         
    * Discover summer wildflowers, snow gums and a range of fauna, including wombats, wallabies, echidnas, lyrebirds and flame robins

    Mount Eccles National Park, 6120 ha in size, stands at the western edge of the volcanic plains that stretch from Melbourne to Port Fairy, extending northwards to Hamilton and Ararat. Beginning about 20,000 years ago, volcanic eruptions opened the earth's crust and poured out thousands of tonnes of molten lava, forming Mount Eccles and the surrounding landscape.
     
     
    Today, the three main craters hold a 700 metre long lake known as Lake Surprise, which is fed by underground springs. The once red-hot lava has been covered with the lush green of heathland and Manna Gum forest. Geological features to be seen are extensive lava flows, lava caves, scoria cones and crater lakes.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Walk around the rim then descend into the crater and follow the shoreline of the lake. Take the rough track along the lava canal and see the broken basalt of the old lava flows.
         
    * Explore the inside of a lava cave.
         
    * Swim in the crater of a volcano.
         
    * Visit the Byaduk Caves, one of the most extensive and accessible sets of lava caves in Australia. Only one cave is open to the public - contact the ranger to arrange access.
         
    * Climb Mount Napier (a true volcanic cone) in nearby Mount Napier State Park. Here you can stand on the edge of the most recently active volcano in Victoria and enjoy magnificent views.

    Mount Langi Ghiran is, in many ways, the Shiraz of the region, if not of Australia: intense, textured, a little brooding, and so complex as to bring a smile to the face of the most hardened wine bore. 
     
     
    Trevor Mast has worked wonders here over the last 20 years or so, and his other wines - including Pinot Gris, Riesling, Sangiovese - aren't bad, either, if that's not taking understatement to a silly extreme. 
     
     
    The cellar door commands a magnificent view east over the vineyards, nestled, as it is, at the foot of a rugged mountain range. Ben Canaider

    Mount Richmond is an extinct volcano surrounded by low, flat land. The volcano is covered with a layer of sand blown inland long ago from Discovery Bay. Forest, open heath and scattered swamps cover the park, which is noted for its flora and fauna.
     
     
    Things to do 
    
     
    
    The park is ideal for a picnic lunch. Use of private gas barbecues is encouraged. There are also a variety of walks including:
    
         
    * Benwerrin Nature Walk - 1 hour.
         
    * Noels Walk - 1 hour (the last section is fairly steep).
         
    * West Walk - 1 hour (may be wet in places in winter and spring).
         
    * Ocean View Walk - 1 hour (views of Cape Bridgewater and Discovery Bay).
    
     
     
    Heritage 
    
    The mountain itself consists not of basalt but of tuff: a porous rock formed when volcanic ash gradually hardened over two million years ago. 
     
     
    Mount Richmond was named after Richmond Henty, one of the first European children born in the Portland area. The national park was established in 1960, as a result of the dedication of local naturalists such as Noel Learmonth and Cliff Beauglehole. 
    
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Mountain Fresh Sushi Express is the first Sushi bar in the Dandenong Ranges with locals and tourists being entertained by the miniature Sushi Express train as it puffs its way along the countertop. 
    
     
    
    It draws carriages of sushi portions, each one meticulously prepared by master chef Jae Kim, based on his 15+ years experience from all over the world.  It's a travelling kaleidoscope of edible colours, with the bright orange of flying fish roe (Tobiko) contrasting with the vivid green of avocado, wasabi and cucumber and the fresh pink of salmon, tuna and prawn. 
    
     
    
    For those who prefer a more conventional setting to the express train counter, there is a light and airy lounge at the rear overlooking the treetops and of course a full take away service with individual hand rolls, salads and mixed sashimi boxes perfect for a picnic in the hills.  
    
     
    
    At Sushi Express we pride ourselves on providing a high quality, healthy product - all sushi is prepared fresh daily so it has that clean, light and refreshing taste that only good quality sushi can offer. 
    
     
    
    The Sushi Express miniature railway was imported from Germany to match the high quality fit out of the premises.  The train counter was custom made with a stunning stone benchtop and the surroundings are freshly decorated in lime green with warm wooden elements and sparkling stainless steel.  No expense has been spared to create a top class Japanese style establishment. Specialist kitchen equipment has been installed to prepare authentic sushi in a range of classic and modern styles including vegetarian and vegan dishes. 
    
     
    
    Sushi Express is at the roundabout end of Belgrave, near the pedestrian lights.  It's open for lunch and early dinner Tuesday to Sunday so locals and tourists can take advantage of the first Sushi bar in the hills.

    Turn off the busy Northern Highway and drive through a leafy glade to find this small winery. Situated right on the best Heathcote vineyard strip, it has a timeless feel emphasised by the simple, stone-floored, baltic pine tasting room, rustic homestead and outbuildings. Adrian and Deborah Munari are very welcoming hosts. The reds made from Shiraz and Merlot are right in the potent regional mainstream, and Chardonnay is promising. Demand, particularly from export markets, can exceed supply here, so the wines can be hard to find in metropolitan areas. Ralph Kyte-Powell

    * Take your rubbish with you 
     
    * All plants and animals are protected
     
    * No fires, including barbecues, may be lit on a day of Total Fire Ban

    Murray-Sunset National Park, in Victoria's far north-west corner, is the State's second largest national park. It is in one of the few remaining semi-arid regions in the world where the environment is relatively untouched. With its wide open landscapes, breathtaking sunsets and starry nights, its vastness and isolation, the park is not the place for a day trip - longer stays are recommended.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * All of the tracks within the park are best suited for four-wheel drive, although conventional vehicles can use the Pink Lakes track from Linga, Settlement Track (the northern boundary) and Wallewa or Berribee tracks to Lindsay Island and the Murray River. All tracks are subject to seasonal conditions and up-to-date information should be sought from the ranger.
         
    * There are excellent walking tracks in the Pink Lakes area. However, it is recommended that walkers seek ranger advice before starting longer walks. The Pink Lakes are so named because of their colour during late summer. A red pigment, carotene, is secreted from the alga - best seen early or late in the day or when it is cloudy. The lakes evaporate over summer leaving concentrated salt crusts over black mud.
    
     
     
    Precautions 
    
         
    * Summer temperatures are very high and it is necessary to carry adequate water.
         
    * It is important to check current road conditions with park staff before visiting - tracks become impassable in wet weather, whilst others are suitable for four wheel drive vehicles only. All tracks on Lindsay Island are dry weather only.
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    The Flinders Naval Depot was established on the 1st September 1920 and commissioned HMAS Cerberus 1st April 1921. Located on 4000 acres at the head of Hanns Inlet, HMAS Cerberus is regarded as the premier training establishment for the Royal Australian Navy.
     
     
    The present Museum of HMAS Cerberus was first established by Commander L G Wilson MBE RAN in the early 1980s. The building was built in 1925 as the New Entry's study block, in 1930 when the Royal Australian Naval College was relocated from Jervis Bay the building then became the Cadets' Academic block. During WWII the facility was used as the Drafting Office and then later as the Supply School.
     
     
    Along with your visit to the Museum, you may like to walk around the Memorial Gardens, visit the Chapels or take the opportunity to watch a movie in the Depot's Southern Cross Cinema.

    Things to Do 
     
    The area provides a useful educational experience and is popular with schools studying marine life.
     
     
    Fauna 
     
    The rocky shores and surrounding reefs at Flinders, at the south-west corner of Western Port, are famous for the diversity of their marine life. For over one hundred years, scientists and naturalists have frequented the reefs, and the area has revealed numerous animal species not previously known to science. Recent discoveries include sea stars that brood their young in their stomach and other tiny seastar species that were once thought to be juveniles.
     
     
    Easily visible are numerous rectangular crabs, multicoloured cushion sea-stars, small spiralled shells of all shapes and sizes and rows of daisy-like anemones. The seafloor within the coves (2 - 3 m depth) is carpeted in algae and seagrass, with the larger rocks of the reef covered in kelps, and smaller brown and red algae. The sandy bottom supports large beds of Amphibolis seagrass inhabited by a variety of fish including Saddled Wrasse and Magpie Morwong. Strange box-like Cowfish and Weedy Sea-dragons hover furtively over the seagrass beds.

    As part of the newly formed Goulburn River and Ranges region, only 90 minutes drive from Melbourne, Nagambie is the Horse Capital of Victoria, surrounded by a rich wine culture and the home of Victorian rowing. The Mediterranean style climate of Victoria's Nagambie Lakes District has proved ideal for Nagambie Gold's 1200 olive trees.
     
     
    With the help of family and friends, Susie and Leon Moscovitch planted their trees in two stages during 2000. Inspiration for such a venture stems from Thelma Parris' 12 olive trees, which she planted at her home on Nagambie's High Street. It seemed only fitting that four decades later, the family owned farm should be the site of her daughter's return to the land.
     
     
    The property near the Goulburn Weir had not been actively farmed for several generations and the resulting conditions provided a great challenge. However, the three main olive varieties chosen - Correggiola, Frantoio and Manzanilla - have all gone on to produce delicious extra virgin olive oil in varying styles and combinations.
     
     
    In recent years, Nagambie Gold has won numerous awards for its extra virgin olive oil, including silver and bronze at the Golden Olive Awards.

    Narkoojee has been making quite a splash with their Chardonnay in recent times - this is a rich and flavour-packed wine with no small degree of finesse, and the potential for some bottle development. Indeed, winemaker Harry Friend's range of wines show a dab hand at work. The Cabernet blend is a gentle, classy wine showing good structure and, once again, thoughtful winemaking. The old goldmining town of Walhalla is nearby and the Strzelecki Ranges provide an impressive backdrop to the winery. Ben Canaider

    The buildings structure is built based on the Mongolian Yurts building principle. They were built in the early 1970's and are of interest, consisting of three circular inter-connected concrete structures, covered by three conical concrete roofs, giving the effect of beehives or domes with skylight domes giving natural lighting to the structures. There are no steps or stairs and the isles are wide so there is easy access for wheelchairs and walking frames. \n \n \n\
    Our Museum houses the largest private collection of old dollhouses, dioramas and miniatures on permanent display in Australia, there's something of interest for all ages - some of our museum pieces reflect aspects of life in the 1920's through to the present day.  Our main visitor demographic are persons aged 50 and over, although we do see lots of young families enjoying their visits. \n \n \n\
    Caf\xC3\xA9 Puppenhaus is recognized for its scrumptious home made food scones, quiches, frittatas and lasagne to name a few.

    Stretching from the top of St Kilda Road across the Yarra River to Federation Square, this cultural heartland encompasses the transformed NGV International on St Kilda Road, The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia at Federation Square, and The Arts Centre - all just a short stroll from each other. 
     
     
    NGV International at 180 St Kilda Road, Melbourne. 
     
     
    A whole world of international art - displaying the NGV's collections of European, Asian, Oceanic and American Art. Since the NGV opened in St Kilda Road in 1968, the total collection has doubled in size to more than 70,000 works of art. A truly iconic Melbourne building, the gallery has been totally redesigned to house one of the most impressive collections in the Southern Hemisphere. 
     
     
    The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia at Federation Square

    A sporting moment happens once. Never to be repeated. A split second in time, captured forever. They live in the minds of the people: who competed, who were there, and who pass their stories from generation to generation. They shape our collective view of ourselves, and our country.

    Built in 1920 as the Victory Theatre (a cinema), the National Theatre was converted into a live performance venue in 1972-74. It functions today as a community arts centre for over 70 groups including musical comedy performances, dance companies, multi-cultural events and school groups. Annual Festivals are held by groups as diverse as the Latvian Community, Surfing Films and the St Kilda Writers' Festival. Commercial events recently have included Janis Ian, Henry Rollins, Rufus Wainwright and Edgley Productions' Swan Lake. School holidays usually feature the Reel Holidays programme - recent release films shown at very low prices (usually free to adults accompanied by children). As the events vary it is wise to check the box office on 95254611.
     
     
    Beneath the theatre in what was the original theatre stalls seating are Australia's oldest performing arts schools. The National Theatre Ballet School was begun in 1939, just a few years after the Drama School in 1936. The Company itself celebrates its 70th birthday in December 2005. The schools offer training for all ages in both unaccredited hobby courses as well as Diploma and Advanced Diplomas of Arts. The Ballet School also accepts international students in its full-time courses. Drama contact is 95340223 and Ballet 95340224.
     
     
    Historically the conversion saved the bulk of the auditorium and all of the main foyers which are now protected by heritage controls, as is the exterior. The existing building is substantially the 1928 renovation undertaken by then owner Frank Thring (snr), father of the actor. Frank Thring Snr was very involved in both the film making and film distribution businesses in early Australia so the site is important for that reason.
     
     
    The venue itself is open to hire as well as the home of many performances by the schools themselves.

    The National Vietnam Veterans Museum is a treasure house of Vietnam era memorabilia and the spiritual home of all Vietnam Veterans. We bring to life the story of Australia's longest war.
     
     
    The armoury contains weaponry of the period. Displays include exquisitely made diorama, photographs, uniforms, equipment and vehicles. The Vietnamese Community has contributed cultural artefacts and information. 
     
     
    The Huey Cobra helicopter, the exhibit with attitude  is an awesome sight, armament intact, the only one in Australia. The 'Light and Sound Show is technical excellence and provides an overview of Australia's involvement; an evocative and very moving experience.   
     
     
    Veterans are fascinated by the balls that decided their fate in the lottery of  conscription . The Long Tan cross replica, made for the 40th Anniversary commemoration, stands proudly in the Garden of Reflection, whilst the wall of  bricks ; is the tribute, by families and friends of veterans, honouring their service.
     
     
    The Museum has great historical and cultural significance for Australians of all ages.   Entertaining and educational, whilst making no political comment, just showing how it was.
     
     
    Our Research Library and Archive holds much information useful to students and historical scholars, offering on-line facilities for research relating to the Vietnam conflict and listings of personnel, enabling visitors to track family involvement in the armed forces at that time.
     
     
    This Museum is the result of much effort by the Veterans themselves, relying almost wholly on volunteer labour for the construction, fitting and dressing of the building. The staff consists of volunteers who are themselves Veterans or people connected in some way to the Veteran Community.  
     
     
    A visit to this new attraction will bring back memories for some and provide food for thought for others. Our Caf  serves light snacks and great coffee while our shop has unique memorabilia popular with all visitors.

    The National Wool Museum is housed in a beautifully restored 1872 bluestone wool store and is set amongst the contemporary striking design of Waterfront Geelong.  
     
     
    The Museum is Australia's only comprehensive museum of wool, showcasing the Australian wool story - from the sheep's back to the clothes rack, and from the birth of the industry in the 1840's to its place in the world today.
     
     
    The Museum has two permanent galleries. The first, The Wool Harvest, looks at sheep farming and wool production. Exploring the pastoral aspect of wool in Australia, visitors can follow the path of the fleece through shearing, classing, wool pressing and dispatch. A recreated shearing shed and a film about shearing demonstrate what life in the shearing industry was like. Shearing demonstrations are offered regularly during school holidays and can be arranged for group bookings.
     
     
    Gallery Two, From Fleece to Fabric, looks at the processing of wool into fabric and offers an insight into the people and processes involved in the textile industry. A sequential display of the machinery actually used in the process demonstrates the transformation of fleece to fabric. The 1910 Axminster Jacquard carpet loom is still operated by skilled carpet weavers and produces the Museum's own Manor House Rug.
     
     
    The Museum also has an exciting annual calendar of temporary exhibitions and events. On the Ground Floor, the Museum Shop stocks a wide range of woollen products and unique local crafts while Lamby's Restaurant offers great food, wines, coffee and cakes. The Museum is fully wheel chair accessible.

    It's hard to meet a keen wine drinker who either doesn't love or at least admire Nicholson River's Chardonnay - considered by many pundits to be one of Australia's greatest. It shows intensity and power, but with an emphasis on structure rather than fruity-tuitiness. And it's from a tiny little place on Victoria's east coast near Lakes Entrance. Crop levels are low here, and Bass Strait often gives this area a real blast, but Nicholson River happily soldiers on. Pinot Noir is well worth a second taste here, too. Ben Canaider

    Covering 2,750 hectares and five kilometres of coastline, this park is located 30 kilometres south of Sale adjacent to the Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park. The calcarenite reefs here are dominated by invertebrates including sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, hydroids and soft coral.
     
     
    The Ninety-Mile Beach area has been found to have the highest species diversity anywhere on the planet. In ten square metres 860 species were discovered living in the sand and in one square metre a staggering 187 species.
     
     
    Victoria's Ninety Mile Beach lies on the edge of a long slender sand dune, thrown up from the sea by the easterly waves and protecting the Gippsland Lakes. The fine sands of East Gippsland appear to harbour more animals per square metre than most other marine habitats in the world. This great diversity is derived from the myriad of small creatures that call this area home. Creatures that burrow into the sand build tiny tubes or scurry around eating the scraps of food that may drift by. Larger animals are far fewer in number.
     
     
    There are no rocky headlands or platforms along this coast. Offshore, the sandy plains are only occasionally broken by low ribbons of reef which formed as shorelines or sand dunes during ice-ages when the sea-level was lower than today. Even these reefs are periodically covered by sand, shifted around by the strong tidal currents.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Nyerimilang Heritage Park is on the shores of the Gippsland Lakes, 10 kilometres by road north-west of Lakes Entrance. The park is ideal for picnics featuring attractive gardens and pastoral surroundings and walks along bush and farm tracks. The park also offers magnificent views across Reeve Channel and the lakes beyond.
     
     
    Things to Do 
     
    Nyerimilang is used by local community groups for activities concerned with history and the natural environment. These events are advertised locally and are generally open to all park visitors.
     
     
    Walking tracks
    
     
    * Whistling Kite Track (0.75 km - 10 mins one way): after a grassland walk, the track passes through various forest types. The Whistling Kite, a large brown hawk, nests in the tall Blue Gums that surround this short walk.
     
    * Homestead Track (1.1 km - 25 mins one way): the original entrance to Nyerimilang Homestead was via this track from Maringa Creek crossing. Leaving the homestead, the track gently descends through moist gully vegetation to swamp, then salt marsh.
     
    * Cliff Top Walk (1.7 km - 30 mins one way): the meandering, mostly level track affords the visitor panoramic views of the nearby lake system and Bass Strait beyond.
     
    * Kurrajong Track (0.75 km - 10 mins one way): this track is a link between Cliff Top and Homestead tracks. The Kurrajong, an evergreen native tree, is most obvious on the northern end of this track.
     
    * Salt Marsh Track (1.2 km - 25 mins one way): the track is from the Kalimna West road to Reeve Channel. The salt marsh environment surrounding the tidal Maringa Creek gives way to the sandy shoreline of the lake system.
     
    * Bird Hide Track (0.4 km - 5 mins one way): commences at the intersection of Cliff Top Walk and Salt Marsh Track.

    Oak Hill Community Arts Co-operative Ltd is a not-for-profit organization run by volunteers under the direction of a Board of Directors, and operates Oak Hill Community Gallery as a community access 'space-for-hire' showcase of affordable art. There are artists' studios (previously farm outbuildings) situated in the landscaped grounds.
     
     
    We offer the public and art lovers alike the opportunity to appreciate a wide variety of styles from the traditional to contemporary, the conventional to the absurd. Oak Hill Community Gallery exhibits works by professional and up-and-coming artists with exhibitions held on a monthly basis. Our aim is to encourage and host new moves of art while continuing to embrace and respect the ancestry of art.
     
     
    Built in 1892, Oak Hill Community Gallery is a beautiful Italianate-style Victorian villa. It is a significant building within the Mornington Peninsula region and is a local identity. The five exhibition spaces within the building are a series of warm contemporary rooms with high ceilings and polished floors. Original fireplaces have been retained, as has the verandah.
     
     
     
     
     
    Oak Hill Community Gallery has ample parking with some overflow available at the Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery situated directly behind the grounds of Oak Hill. A charming tree-lined country path meanders through the expansive grounds, past the working artist studios from Oak Hill Community Gallery to the MPRG, and further to the Civic Reserve. A large civic rose garden is being established on the western boundary.
     
     
    The Co-operative offers Oak Hill as a special event venue to the community.
     
     
    The major aim of Oak Hill Community Gallery is to cultivate an environment that will inspire and enthuse artists from all walks of life, that will encourage public participation, and will encourage other galleries to offer the next career step to the talented artists showcased here.

Proprietor Maria Viola, is the  fourth generation descendant of the Lucini brothers who fled to Australia as a political refugees from Intra, near Lake Maggiore close to the Swiss-Italian border. \n\n \n\n\
    Whilst renovation and funding is an ongoing process to rejuvenate the property, Maria and her son Matt welcome visitors to the property every weekend and invite them to share some of the magic they have inherited. \n\n \n\n\
    Lucini's Pasta Caf\xC3\xA9 is fully licensed and operates Friday to Sunday for lunch and dinner with an Italian local produce menu and wines from the Daylesford-Macedon region. \n\n \n\n\
    Historic one hour fresco tours are on Saturday and Sunday at 10.30 am AUD10. They offer a rare experience and insight into the fascinating history of the family's re-location to Australia. Much of their story is told through the unique and colourful frescoes that decorate the ceilings and walls. Special tour groups and meal packages can be arranged at other times during the week.\n \n \n\
    In 2009 the property celebrated 150 years with important milestones. A Pioneer's Avenue of honour salutes the many nationalities who settled in the area during the gold rush and worked at the  Jim Crow Diggings. This commemorative community project is ongoing and families can be recognised with the planting of trees down the driveway of the property. Participation is open to descendants at a contribution of AUD150. \n\n \n\n\
    The property wears many caps. It is a museum, a heritage listed building, a caf\xC3\xA9, a tour group fascination. It has a rambling garden, bocce court, piazza and garden stage. It offers simple pleasures and many different experiences for visitors. Many local festivals and events are a part of the annual program including the Geranium & Herb Festival and the Swiss Italian Festival."

    Magnificent views and a rich variety of spring wildflowers are 2 of the reserve's features.
     
     
    Things to see and do:
     
     
    There are several picnic areas in the reserve and wood barbecues are provided at most of them. You can also camp for short stays at a number of camping sites with limited facilities.
     
     
    Walking
    
         
    * Breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside rewards walkers to the summit.
         
    * The best way to enjoy the reserve is with a stroll. Why not take time out to explore the natural splendour of the Mount.
         
    * A network of tracks links all major features within the reserve. Remember to wear strong footwear and suitable clothing as some sections of track are steep.
    
     
     
    Horse Riding
    
         
    * The reserve is an attractive setting for riding.
         
    * Horses can only be ridden on formed roads open for public use and must not be taken on walking tracks.
    
     
     
    Mountain Bike Riding
    
         
    * There are many opportunities for bike riders to explore the reserve on existing vehicle tracks.
         
    * Bicycles are not permitted on walking tracks.
    
     
     
     
     
     
    Precautions 
    
    Take care when walking off tracks - our native wildlife protected here includes snakes.

    A set of basalt columns as straight and regular as organ pipes is the central feature of this 121 ha park, set in a deep gorge in the bare Keilor plains. There are other rock phenomena and the park is worth visiting for its native vegetation and variety of birds.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * The park is an excellent place for picnics, walks, bird observing and photography.
         
    * Stand on the viewing platform - the basalt Keilor Plains all around you are part of one of the world's largest lava flows.
         
    * Walk down the path to view the 'organ pipes' - a set of basalt columns formed by lava.
         
    * Look for yellowish sandstones and mudstones across the creek 200 metres downstream from the 'organ pipes'.
         
    * Fossils in these rocks suggest they are sedimentary rocks laid down under the sea about 400 million years ago.
         
    * Walk upstream about 400 metres past the 'organ pipes' and see Rosette Rock - a radial array of basalt columns like the spokes of a wheel.
         
    * Look at the Tessellated Pavement, the tops of basalt columns.
         
    * Enjoy a picnic while looking out for waterbirds, blue wrens, cockatoos, rosellas, magpies and wedge-tailed eagles.
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Outlook Hill Vineyard is owned and operated by Peter and Lydia Snow and is located between the two wine touring highways - Maroondah and Melba that wind through Victoria's top wine region.  The slopes of Outlook Hill command panoramic views of the Yarra Valley wine country and surrounding hills in a perfect setting for all seasons to retreat and relax, be with friends, enjoy great food and wine.
     
     
    In addition to the vineyard, the Snows have luxury boutique cottage accommodation and an acclaimed restaurant on the same vineyard slopes.  The family give a high priority to the production of ultra premium wines.  The show awards and media results to date they are particularly proud of successive year top 5 Australasian finalist wines in the National Winestate magazine's annual awards for their Chardonnay and Pinot Noir varieties.
     
     
    There are serveral explanations for the continuing success of Outlook Hill as an important regional producer since establishment in 2000:-
    
         
    * The Snows planted out, live and work on the single vineyard property.
         
    * A low intervention, organic (as practicable) viticulture policy resulting in healthy soils, vines and wine for the table.
         
    * Ancient shallow soils with heavy clay subsoil providing a natural contribution to low vine vigour/yields and high fruit quality.
         
    * Single vineyard fruit, uncluttered focussed wines with individuality.
         
    * Emphasis on regional character/terroir expression in the wines: e.g. Cabernet  with a rich, chocolatey, concentration of fruit and tannins; Pinot Noir  with good layering of spice and earthiness and velvet texture; Chardonnay with a minerality and acid balance particular to the Yarra Valley.

    Our idea for Paradigm Hill was conceived almost 30 years ago. We have always been passionate about food and wine and our  other  careers have laid the foundation for this adventure.  
    
     
    
    As with so many other things we ve ever tackled   it s been a case of  all or none  and our obsession with the pursuit of quality has meant pushing the boundaries with viticulture and viniculture and to work within the domain of ecologically responsible practices.
     
     
    It has often been said, great wine is made in the vineyard ..We have just over 10 acres of north facing gently sloping vineyard. The vineyard has been established with a very low density of vines (average only 500 vines per acre) grafted onto vigour and phylloxera resistant rootstock.  
    
     
    
    The trellis runs north south and vines have been trained to a VSP approach with a keen eye on ensuring a balanced vine. We are committed to using only estate grown grapes for on site production of Pinot Noir, Shiraz, Pinot Gris and Riesling.  
    
     
    
    The philosophy of our wine making is to guide the wine with minimal intervention, through the vinification process. Our fruit is picked by loving hands, with vintage being a time for celebration.

    Set high in the Macedon Ranges near Hanging Rock, Woodend, Kyneton and Lancefield, Paramoor Winery is rapidly establishing itself among the very best of the wine producers in this coolest of Australia's wine making regions. Wine guru James Halliday has included a Paramoor wine in his national 'best of the best' listings by variety in both his 2009 and 2010 'Australian Wine Companions'-- the 2006 Paramoor 'The Fraser' Shiraz/Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot ( 96 points) and the 2008 Paramoor Riesling (95 points). A number of other wines have been awarded between 90 and 93 points-- so, whilst still rated at 4.5 stars, Paramoor is well and truly knocking on the door of the maximum 5 stars!
     
     
    A wide range of wines are produced including whites (Riesling, Botrytis Riesling, Chardonnay/Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris/Pinot Noir) and reds (Pinot Noir, Shiraz, Shiraz/Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot). Total production during 2010 is expected to be about 1200 cases.
     
     
    Paramoor's farm, accommodation and winery buildings complement its beautiful bush scenery in a unique fashion. The property's history, prior to purchase by the current owners, Will and Kathy Fraser, was as a working Clydesdale horse farm. Two of the original Clydesdales remain, as well as a wide array of horse drawn carts, ploughs and mowers. The heritage nineteenth century style barn is one of a kind, providing room for a blacksmith's forge. a tack room and various stalls. It is in this amazing space that Paramoor has sited its cellar door sales area.
     
     
    Many musical concerts are held each year in the barn, including by the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of Victoria, the Victorian Harp Society as well as a monthly Celtic and Australian folk music evening.

    The thriving canal system of the Patterson Lakes residential area and the wet and dry storage at the Whalers Cove Marina combine with four public boat ramps to make an extremely busy waterway.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * A well known feature of the Patterson River is the National Water Sports Centre (NWSC), Riverend Road, Bangholme.
     
    * The centre was developed as an international standard rowing course in preparation for Melbourne's bid for the 1988 Olympics. Unfortunately, this and later bids did not succeed.
     
    * The NWSC is now used for a more diverse range of water based activities including rowing, water skiing, canoeing, kayaking, triathlons, coarse angling, jet skis and radio controlled yachts.
     
    * For information on the National Water Sports Centre call 03 9772 1001.
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    The Patterson River is a man made waterway, created in 1876 to provide direct drainage from the entire Dandenong Valley catchment area. This run-off flowed into the Carrum Swamp, which spread behind the sand dunes between Mordialloc and Frankston with the only outlets to the bay being the Mordialloc Creek and the Kananook Creek at Frankston. 
     
     
    In 1934, 960 houses and farms were inundated by floodwaters. It was then decided to raise the levels of the artificial banks between the bay and Pillars Bridge, south of Dandenong. The river mouth is regularly inspected by Parks Victoria and contractors are employed to dredge the outlet to a safe depth when needed.

    Although its name immortalises Geelong's first vigneron, the Swiss-born David Pettavel who arrived in these parts in 1842, this grand new enterprise is as modern as tomorrow. A broad driveway leads to an imposing, contemporary winery/restaurant complex surrounded by vineyard. From there you can look across the broad landscape that was once the heart of the Geelong vignoble while enjoying great food or tasting the estate's range of regional wines. As one would expect from a Geelong winery, complex Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are stand-outs in a large range of well-made wines.

    They make a bit of everything at Pfeiffer including two varieties you wouldn't normally associate with Rutherglen - Pinot Noir and Gamay.  
    
     
    
    They also make a wonderful wine called The Piper which is released with a decade or more bottle age and contains the grape variety Cabernet Sanzey which is so obscure it doesn't even rate a mention in the Oxford Companion to Wine.  
    
     
    
    The fortifieds are wonderful and the hospitality peerless.Ben CanaiderP.G Wodehouse's character Psmith (The P is silent!) would not be out of place at Pfeiffer Wines. Pfeiffers Pfine Wine Pfor Pfine Pfood and Pfabulous Pfolk, reads the slogan at the winery at Wahgunyah, near Rutherglen. 
    
     
    
    It labours the point somewhat, but you get the message about the redundant p. There is nothing redundant about Pfeiffers, especially now the second generation is on board. Founders Chris and Robyn have their daughter Jennifer fully involved these days. 
    
     
    
    And they've restored the old bridge across Sunday Creek, a tributary of the Murray near their winery, no doubt with a rosy future in mind. A disused wooden bridge may seem an odd thing to restore, but if you've ever walked across it, or sat under its umbrellas having a lazy lunch, you'll understand. It is a beautiful and tranquil spot.

    The Pioneer Settlement, situated alongside the picturesque banks of the Little Murray River, is a place that leaves you wanting more. From the moment you enter you feel yourself transported back into a typical 1920s Mallee street. The delightful tearooms provide delicious Devonshire Teas while the sounds of the music shop Pianola blend with the horse s hooves and laughter of tourists enjoying free horse and cart rides. 
     
     
    Free vintage car rides are also available, proving a popular way for visitors to absorb the sights offered. Driving along the river is an impressive way to first see Towanninnie Homestead. Made from drop logs, this homestead is a typical 1880 s Mallee homestead, with Mallee root fences, mud brick kitchen, and half cellar. 
    
     
    
    Further along, past Riverside and Keats Cottage is the Lower Murray Inn. The ambience of the Lower Murray Inn is enticing. This area has further been developed, in partnership with the Swan Hill Lions Club and the Friends of the Pioneer Settlement, into a family friendly picnic area. During the school holidays BBQs and children s activities are held here also.    
    
     
    
    With arms full of old fashioned lollies from Sparkes & Perkins General Store and Wanted Posters from The Echo Print Shop a visit to Donna s Ceramics for pottery painting is ideal. While in this area wander the Golden Harvest, marvel at the  array tractors and watch the blacksmith hard at work. 
    
     
    
    Add to your visit a cruise aboard the PS Pyap, dressing up in costume, a walk on Pental Island, a chat with Uncle Bruce about local indigenous culture, and a Sound and Light show at night, it is easy to see why the Pioneer Settlement offers a two day admission pass.

    Approximately 6km from the city, it is one of Melbourne's oldest industrial sites.
     
     
    Pipemakers Park is a historic pipemaking industrial site, which has been transformed into a park and wetlands. Historic bluestone factories have been recycled for community use. A wharf has been built, wetlands created, barbecues and picnic tables installed and an important link formed in the Maribyrnong River trail. The multi-use trail leads 15km upstream to Brimbank Park, East Keilor, and four kilometres downstream to the Stock Bridge at Kensington.

    * Approached from a steep hill, the park has distant river views towards Flemington Racecourse and the city.
     
    * Innovative landscaping retains the theme of the previous industrial history of the site. 
     
    * The main feature is the Living Museum of the West housed in a revamped factory, which provides information for self-guided tours and hosts a number of exhibitions, activities and special presentations on the cultural history of western Melbourne and the Maribyrnong River.
     
    * Try fishing from the wharf
     
    * Go for a boat ride on the Maribyrnong River

    Designed to take advantage of the steep slopes, the 11 hectare terraced gardens of Pirianda are distinctive for their combination of botanically important trees, shrubs and perennials with an overstorey of large blackwoods and mountain ash towering over the natural fern gullies. The garden is particularly beautiful in autumn when the trees change colour to the many hues of orange, red and yellow.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Enjoy magnificent views and tranquil walks, bird watching, photography and informal picnicking on the lawns at Pirianda Gardens.
         
    * From the pathway across the top of open lawns at Pirianda, the view south takes in Kallista and the valley of Sassafras Creek and parts of Sherbrooke Forest. On a clear day you can see Arthur's Seat on the Mornington Peninsula and French Island in Westernport.
         
    * Several walking paths cross the steep slopes through the gardens and a sign-posted pathway and garden map indicate points of interest.
         
    * A gazebo located near the top of the garden is an excellent location for your picnic and it is also available for hire for weddings and wedding photography.

    The Plunkett and Fowles families have a deep appreciation for the granite-rich Strathbogie Ranges.  For decades we have worked hard developing extensive local knowledge: from pioneering fruit growing to understanding the personality of individual vineyard blocks and by experimenting with creative winemaking.  Our greatest sense of achievement comes from crafting wines that you love to drink and share. 
    
     
    
    We live in the rugged Strathbogie Ranges - a striking, ancient granite massif that rises to over 700 metres above sea level.  We are surrounded by dramatic granite outcrops scattered across these ancient highlands. The region provides wonderful conditions for growing wine grapes: in the coolness of spring the vines produce only small berries, while the rich summer sunshine creates fruit dense in colour and flavour. Our vineyards grow a full array of the finest French varietals, while an innovative small-planting program extends our range into exotic grapevines from Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal and parts of Europe.

    Rugged sandstone cliffs overlook the Point Addis Marine National Park that covers 4,600 hectares from the Victorian State limit at sea, along 10 kilometres of coastline between Anglesea and Jan Juc. This marine national park is representative of the central Victorian coastline and is exposed to the intense wave action that arrives on this coast largely from the southwest. The waves are a major part of this environment and shape the coastal landforms as well as the animals and plants that live in the area.
     
     
    The Point Addis Marine National Park also includes the world famous Bells Beach, a beach noted for its waves and surfing. Bells Beach features as one site for international surf competitions including the annual Rip Curl Classic.
     
     
    Offshore, there are a number of small rocky reefs including Ingoldsby Reef, a popular local diving destination.
     
     
    Things to do   
    
    Surfing is a major activity within the Marine National Park and Bells Beach is home to international surfing competitions. Addiscott Beach is also popular for surfing.
     
     
    Ingoldsby Reef is widely used as a popular location for diving.

    Point Cook Coastal  Park features abundant birdlife, an historic bluestone homestead, intertidal sand banks and a Marine Reserve. Located 20 km southwest of Melbourne, it is a popular destination for birdwatchers, nature lovers and family groups.
     
     
    Over 250 fauna species have been recorded at Point Cook Coastal Park. During the Victorian summer, visiting migratory birds move between the wetlands and saltmarsh at Point Cook, the beach sand flats and Cheetham Wetlands, depending on the tides. The endangered Orange-bellied Parrot is known to feed in the saltmarsh at Point Cooke.
     
     
    Things to do
    
         
    * Enjoy a barbecue or picnic      by the beach.
         
    * Explore the area via the      many tracks located in the park.
         
    * Watch birds from the      tranquil Spectacle Lakes birdhide, or from the Cheetham Wetlands       Tower.

    The new Point Cooke Marine Sanctuary covers 290 hectares and is located 10 kilometres east of Werribee, adjoining Point Cooke Coastal Park and including the existing Point Cooke Marine Reserve. 
     
     
    The Point Cooke Marine Sanctuary, which is protected from the bustle of the suburbs by coastal dunes and adjacent wetlands, consists of a rock platform, isolated boulders, soft sands and mud and supports an array of algae, benthic (bottom dwelling) fauna, invertebrates and fish. The significant wetlands of the adjoining Point Cooke Coastal Park are part of the Port Phillip (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar wetland site. 
     
     
    Things to Do
     
     
    Try diving at Point Cooke where you may encounter, amongst other marine life, entertaining little fish called Southern Blennies. 
     
     
    Facilities
     
     
    The beach picnic area provides public facilities including picnic shelters, free gas barbeques, toilets, change rooms and showers. Carparks and toilets are available for disabled visitors. 
     
     
    Fauna
     
     
    The principal plant on the reef is the bushy brown seaweed, Sargassum, which harbours innumerable tiny animals and plants between its leaf-like fronds. Prickly sea urchins are abundant near crevices, while the exposed sections of rock support a range of life including masses of worm tubes, carpets of anemones and meadows of tufting coralline and filamentous algae. In darker corners, sponges grow plentifully. 
     
     
    Small sharks and skates patrol the surrounding eelgrass beds and muddy seafloor, feasting off the bivalves that lie deep in the sediment. In late summer, swarms of jellyfish pulsate over the reefs, clearing the water of the microscopic plants and animals that build up in the nutrient rich environment. Bryozoans, sea stars, ascidians, bivalves, crustaceans, molluscs, sharks, skates and many other species of fish also occur in the area.

    Things to Do 
    
     
    
    Point Danger is very popular for sightseeing and shore walks, and is visited by large numbers of people. The point is also a popular surf break. Snorkelling around Point Danger is a great way to see some of the diversity of the area. Safety considerations include currents and swell.

    This 4000 hectare park, adjacent to Croajingolong National Park, is about 25 kilometres southeast of Cann River in East Gippsland. The granite cliffs of Point Hicks overlook the park which contains a very rich marine fauna. This includes intertidal and shallow subtidal invertebrates, colourful and diverse sessile invertebrates living on spectacular subtidal reefs, kelps and small algae and a high diversity of reef fish.
     
     
    Diving around Whaleback Rock or Sensation Reef is a truly amazing experience. The water is often very clear with sunlight glinting off schools of silver fish. 
     
    Point Hicks represents Victoria's warm far-eastern marine environment. Many animals occurring here will not grow or survive in the cooler waters further west. The most obvious of these is the large Black Sea-urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii) that mows down the seaweeds near its shelter, creating an open environment of pink coralline-encrusted rocks. 
     
    Besides subtidal reef, the environment around Point Hicks includes attractive intertidal rock platforms and offshore sands. The seafloor drops away rapidly from shore, descending to 90 metres depth and is one of the deepest marine areas within Victoria.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
     
    * The area's rich marine life makes snorkelling and scuba diving a popular pursuit in the region.

    Famous for the Twelve Apostles and historic shipwrecks, Port Campbell National Park contains the most significant areas of vegetation and fauna native to south-western Victoria. The diverse range of coastal environments includes woodlands, dunes, wetlands, coastal cliffs, limestone stacks and arches.
     
     
    The Twelve Apostles are stacks are made of rock formed up to 20 million years ago, and are created by the sea gradually eroding the soft limestone cliffs. The coast is slowly changing and there are frequent small rock falls. There are also infrequent major events, the most recent occurred on Sunday 3 July 2005 when a large stack collapsed.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
     
    * Scenic drives along the Great Ocean Road, stopping at points of interest.
     
    * Three self-guided walks at Loch Ard Gorge that introduce shipwreck history, geology, and coastal ecology.
     
    * Watch the thousands of Muttonbirds (Short-tailed Shearwaters) that fly in to their nest burrows from the sea each evening in summer.
     
    * Call at the National Park Information Centre in Port Campbell.
     
    * Try the Port Campbell Discovery Walk that heads west from the township.
     
    * Swim or surf at Port Campbell.
     
    * Snorkelling and scuba diving tours available.
     
     
    Heritage 
     
    Aboriginal people cut steps down the sheer cliffs along the coast to gain access to marine food sources.
     
     
    European explorers soon realised the dangers of the coastline and gave it a wide berth, but shipwrecks still occurred, earning it the title of 'The Shipwreck Coast'. Early settlement was based on pastoral runs such as Glenample, and a small fishing port developed at Port Campbell.

    Covering 1,950 square kilometres, Port Phillip is the entrance to Australia's busiest port and is one of Victoria's most popular recreational destinations. Every year millions of people enjoy its vast coastline, world-class swimming beaches and coastal parks. An entirely different perspective however is available to those who explore the Bay by boat. Island, shipwrecks and marine reserves dot the Bay, while scuba diving and fishing reveal the colourful diversity of the Bay's marine life.
     
     
    Over 3.2 million people live around its shore, making Port Phillip Bay Australia's most densely populated catchment. The bay is a large expanse of water that is surprisingly shallow in many places. Nearly half the bay is less than 8 metres deep. Its greatest depth is 24 metres.
     
     
    Studies show that Port Phillip is a dynamic and self sustaining ecosystem which is healthier and cleaner than comparable bays near large cities. The shallowness of the water aids aeration and the many marine plants and organisms keep the bay in good condition.
     
     
    Things to Do 
    
     
    
    Bay charter tours leave regularly from Portsea, Sorrento, Rye, St Kilda, Gem Pier, Portarlington and Queenscliff. Some of the boat launch ramps available for public use are located in Barwon Heads, Frankston, Mornington, Portarlington, Queenscliff, Rye and Sorrento.
     
     
    In addition, Altona Pier, Brookes Jetty, Gem Pier, St Kilda Pier, Werribee Jetty, Portarlington Jetty and Queenscliff Pier are all equipped with barbeque, picnic and playground facilities.
     
     
    Piers, jetties and bay destinations can be hired for weddings, filming, photography and other private use.

    With its proximity to Victoria's largest city the southern end of the Bay has high visitor usage throughout the year with a huge peak over the summer months. The southern Bay is Melbourne's summer playground and many of the areas within Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park are popular for a range of recreational pursuits from snorkelling and SCUBA diving through to passive recreation on the beach. 
    
     
    
    Habitat types found within the park include seagrass beds, sheltered intertidal mudflats, intertidal sandy beaches and rocky shores, subtidal soft substrata and rocky reefs, as well as the open water environment. The diversity and abundance of marine flora and fauna in this region are greater than many comparable habitats elsewhere in the world. The park is located in an area renowned for its diversity of migratory wader birds and includes a number of sites listed under a number of treaties to protect migratory bird habitat including International Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (the Ramsar Convention). 
    
     
    
    The high diversity of marine life around the mouth of Port Phillip is due to the wide range of habitats in the area and its central Victorian location. The area marks the end of the range for some animals and plants that prefer the cold waters of western Victoria, but it also supports warmth-loving species from eastern Australia that can survive in the bay's relatively calm, shallow waters. A high proportion of Victorian species of marine flora and fauna are represented in the Port Phillip Head's region. As an example the area supports about 10 per cent of all of Australia's feathery stinging animals known as known hydroids.

    Punt Road is a major thoroughfare in the middle of Melbourne. Considered one of the busiest roads in Melbourne, it is walking distance from the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Royal Botanical Gardens.
     
     
    Punt Road began in the 1850 s as a quiet dirt road that ran into Yarra River. The road was surrounded by some of the first vineyards in Victoria, and was linked across the river by a punt, which would ferry people and goods to the other side.  A bridge now stands where the punt once was, and the vineyards have been re-established throughout the Yarra Valley, where the grapes for this wine are grown today.
     
     
    The Punt Road range consists of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Late Harvest Semillon. When vintage conditions permit, exclusive parcels will be labelled under the Punt Road MVN reserve label.

    The Queenscliff Historical Museum is dedicated to preserving and displaying the social history of the Borough of Queenscliff since the earliest explorations and settlement in Port Phillip.
     
     
    From 1838 the maritime history began with services offered by pilots such as George Tobin, and lighthouse keepers and signal masters such as Captain John Preston at Point Lonsdale. Their social history is retraced through the Museum's records and displays.
     
     
    From 1853 when the area known as Shortland's Bluff was proclaimed the township of Queenscliff, the Museum records show the development of private land ownership and of the municipality.
     
     
    The story of the Borough of Queenscliff is displayed through a representative selection from the Museum's collections of personal memorabilia, household artefacts, furniture, maps, photographs, documents and works of art.
     
     
    There is also a display of shipwreck relics recognised by Heritage Victoria. And, a special collection of clothing and textiles including hand embroidered clothes, home made toys, lace and tatting, hats, gloves, shoes and uniforms.
     
     
    The Museum seeks at all times to focus on the people, who as pioneer families, have contributed to the development of the Borough and the wider Australian society. Their names are documented on land titles, voter's rolls, cemetery records and church baptismal records.
     
     
    In the archives of the Museum there is a selection of school registers which record children's enrolment dates, birth dates, father's name and occupation, and previous schools attended.
     
     
    This rich source of information complements the hundreds of personal documents and diaries that have been donated by descendants of pioneers. The growth of the commercial sector in the Borough is reflected by the changing advertisements in the weekly publications of the then local newspaper The Sentinel.

    The Red Cliffs Historical Steam Railway was formed in 1994 under the auspices of the Red Cliffs Rotary Club to operate the restored Kerr Stuart 0-4-2T steam locomotive named 'Lukee'  (B/N 742/1901) that formerly operated between Red Cliffs railway station and the Red Cliffs pumping station. A two kilometre section of the former 1600mm gauge Red Cliffs - Morkalla branch line has been converted to 610mm gauge for tourist train operation.
     
     
     
     
     
    The train normally operates on the first Sunday of each month from 11am to 4.00pm and on Easter Saturday and the Sunday of the Queens Birthday long weekend.
     
     
    The Train does not operate in January or February because of the fire danger.
     
     
    In 2004 Red Cliffs Historical Railway purchased an EM Baldwin diesel locomotive which after extensive renovation by members Russell Savage and John Page was commissioned in June 2005. Named 'Harry' the Locomotive regularly shares running days with 'Lukee' and gives the Railway the flexibility of one off specials.
     
     
    Red Cliffs Historical Steam Railway is located on the corner of the Calder Hwy and Millewa Rd Red Cliffs and is approximately two kilometres from the Red Cliffs township.

    The Red Hill Brewery is the first and only microbrewery on the Mornington Peninsula.  Set amidst the hop vines, in a beautiful rural environment, taste the beers, stay for a delicious beer-friendly meal or purchase fine handcrafted ales to take home.
     
     
    The Brewery is unique as it has its own hop yard where all the hops are grown organically to use in the beers. The hops are a dramatic spectacle, growing over four metres high, and on full display to visitors to the brewery. Using our own hops imparts fresh and unique hop flavours and aromas to our beers.
     
     
    There are three main beer styles, Golden Ale, Wheat Beer and Scotch Ale.  All are handcrafted using only water, the finest malt, yeast and the organically grown hops. 
     
     
    The flagship beer, the Golden Ale, is a very pale and crisp light bodied ale, fruity with a refreshing tanginess. It has a delicate hoppy dryness created by the use of the hops grown onsite at the Brewery. A very easy drinking style and perfect on a warm day, or all day! The Wheat Beer is in the famous Bavarian style, highly aromatic and carbonated with a banana like fruitiness in the palate and soft clove spiciness in the aroma. The Scotch Ale is a malty ale which is a deep red colour and has a caramel sweetness. Seasonal specialty beers also feature regularly.
     
     
    Set in a beautiful rural environment, the Red Hill Brewery has a small eatery committed to serving real food. The food is influenced by the cuisines of the great beer loving nations of England, Belgium and Germany where the favourite dishes have developed over centuries according to how well they match the famous beer styles.  Local produce is featured on the menu and all the food is made in house.

- :description: |-
    Trevor and Jan Brandon established their small Cheesery and Cellar Door on the farm at Red Hill in April 2000, producing distinctive, handcrafted regional cheeses to complement Mornington Peninsula wines. They were first inspired by farmhouse cheesemaking in Europe, and draw upon Trevor's experience as a food microbiologist.
     
     
    They are joined by their son Burke and his family. Burke is a graduate in agriculture, with extensive training in cheesemaking, and has a particular interest in the management of cheese maturation and flavour development. During 2008 Burke & wife Bronwyn began milking their flock of East Friesian sheep and now produce small quantities of sheep blue and luscious yoghurt.
     
     
    A seasonal range of specialist cheese is made using fresh organic cow milk and free-range goat and sheep milk, each from a single herd. Red Hill cheeses use vegetarian rennet, and are free from genetically modified organisms, stabilisers and preservatives.
     
     
    Red Hill cheeses have won multiple awards over the last 9 years culminating in the 2009 Grand Dairy Award of Champion Goat Cheese for the rare Mountain Goat Blue. Slow processing and gentle handling help preserve the raw qualities of the clean rich milk, resulting in cheeses with character and great depth of flavour.
     
     
    Pay a visit to the Cellar Door Shop at the Cheesery, and you will enter a tantalising world of unique flavours from sublime ashed logs to the uplifting washed rinds. Enjoy the intimate Cheese Tasting Experience with a Tasting Plate or Cheese Platter and purchase from the entire range of cheeses and gourmet accompaniments.
     
     
    The Cellar Door caters for self-drive cheeselovers in groups of fewer than 10 people. Small-group packages available.
     
     
    Home Cheesemaking Classes are held regularly.

    RedBeard has been seen on TV in Coxy's Big Break, Postcards and Wine Me Dine Me; as well as featuring in The Age Epicure, The Herald Weekly Times, Country Style, Delicious, and Earth Garden; and in the 2009 Business Victoria Regional Heroes photographic exhibition.\n \n \n\
    About your experience\n \n \n\
    Products \n\n\
    Few bakeries in Australia create handmade, organic sourdough bread and pastries. Even fewer use a huge 120 year old wood-fired Scotch oven.\n \n \n\
    Our simple doughs of certified organic flours, salt and water are hand-shaped using traditional techniques, and transformed by the alchemy of natural fermentation and wood-fired baking into a range of loaves of outstanding colour, texture and flavour. We also bake perfect pastries and beaut biscuits.\n \n \n\
    For a list of retailers and Farmers' Markets, please visit our website.\n \n \n\
    Caf\xC3\xA9 \n\n\
    Open Tuesday to Sunday and most public holidays from 8am to 4pm. With its laid-back retro style, warm interior for winter and shady courtyard for summer, RedBeard's caf\xC3\xA9 is a year-round destination.\n \n \n\
    We use local organic ingredients in season. Our menu includes fair trade coffee, cakes, biscuits, pastries, pies, sausage rolls, soups, focaccias, antipasto, and hot breakfasts (on weekends). We are fully licensed.\n \n \n\

    The eight acre vineyard in Kangaroo Ground at the Western end of the Yarra Valley in the Shire of Nillumbik was planted to Riesling, Chardonnay and Cabernet in 1986.  
    The property was named Wildfell by a pioneering Scotsman, Walter Wippel, who settled this property in the Kangaroo Ground area in the early 1850's; establishing orchards, market gardens and grazing land.
     
     
    No doubt, wine production was high on the list of priorities, and the rich decomposed volcanic soils assisted in this pursuit.
     
     
    Over 150 years on, the Kangaroo Ground area has seen the establishment of a number of new vineyards due to the high quality of the fruit and ideal growing conditions. It's proximity to Melbourne and the rolling hills broken by dense stands of Red Box and other eucalypts makes it a haven for weekend visitors and wine tasters from all over.
     
     
    Enjoy your visit on any Saturday or Sunday at the Redbox Cellar Door in Ness Lane, Kangaroo Ground - in the high country at the west end of the Yarra Valley, where excellence attracts the wine buff, and the Nillumbik landscape enchants all those who venture to explore.

    Reef Hills State Park is an area of 2013 hectares of mixed eucalypt forest near Benalla in the north east of Victoria. The forest is an important remnant of the original vegetation of the northern plains of Victoria and is valued by naturalists for its wide range of plant and animal life. The Grey Box and River Red Gum trees in the forest provide nectar for honey production in the area which is valued by apiarists.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
         
    * Scenic drives, bushwalks, horseriding, picnicking and nature study are some of the most popular activities in the park. Some roads are suitable for bicycle riding.
         
    * Spring (the main wildflower season) and autumn are popular times to visit but there are plenty of things to see and do year round. Several wattles are in flower in the winter months and the large yellow Guinea-flowers can be found most of the year.
    
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    As its name suggests the gold rushes had an impact on this area. Both reef and alluvial gold was uncovered until early this century. Traces of the workings can be seen along the ridges and in the gullies in the northern part of the park.
     
     
    The forest was cut for timber for the gold mines and later during the World War II for charcoal burners and domestic firewood. Commercial harvesting of the timber for fencing materials has continued until recently and small quantities of firewood are still collected for local use.
     
     
    Precautions
    
         
    * Areas have been set aside in the park as firing ranges for rifle and gun clubs.
         
    * Beehives may be located in designated areas within the park from time to time. Visitors should observe warning signs and avoid these areas.

    Ricketts Point also features in paintings by a number of Australia's famous early artists such as Tom Roberts and Fred McCubbin. Information on the paintings is available at sites adjacent to the sanctuary (the Tom Roberts painting The Sunny South was actually painted at Ricketts Point). Information about these paintings is located along the coast and around the Tea Rooms.

    The Riverside Golf Club winds its way along the Murray River six kilometres from the Mildura CBD. The sounds and sights of paddle boats and water birds mingling with the cries of the abundant birdlife in the natural billabongs around the 18 hole course are almost a distraction from the picturesque fairways and verdant greens set amongst the ancient River Red Gums.
     
     
    The old style country clubhouse overlooks the course and offers friendly bar service. Bistro operates during the summer months for country style meals.
     
     
    The Golf Shop stocks necessary items, drinks and snacks plus tuition by a golf professional can be arranged by appointment. Visitors are very welcome to join in on competition days.

    'Arboretum' is a Latin word meaning a place for trees and an Arboretum can simply be called a 'tree museum'.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
         
    * Open daily with free admission, there are many things to see and do at the RJ Hamer Arboretum.
         
    * The picnic area with free electric barbecues is a great place to meet with family and friends.
         
    * Stroll, jog or run through the mix of exotic and native tree species or simply relax and enjoy the breathtaking views across the Yarra Valley out to the Warburton Ranges and beyond.
         
    * The RJ Hamer Arboretum lookout on Woolrich Road hosts two paintings featured in the Heidelberg School Artists Trail. The paintings are Golden afternoon in Olinda c 1924 and View from Farmer's, Olinda c 1924, both by Arthur Streeton.
    
     
     
    Heritage 
    
     
    
    The RJ Hamer Arboretum land is a small part of the original Dandenong and Woori Yallock State forest, proclaimed over 110 years ago. A succession of fires destroyed the original eucalypt forest and during 1948 -1955 softwood trees were planted on site as part of plans to improve Victoria's timber supplies.
     
     
    The fires of 1962 destroyed the majority of these post war plantings and the government then investigated the future use of the area. Plans were developed for the establishment of an exotic forest Arboretum to be used as part of a firebreak for the Olinda township. The RJ Hamer Arboretum is the first known occasion in which a forest style Arboretum was completely established by planting. A basic planting design was completed in 1970 and planting was carried out for the next 15 years.

    Australia's most well-known chef - the pony-tailed restaurateur and TV personality Neil Perry - has created a sumptuous premium steakhouse at Melbourne's Crown Casino precinct.
     
     
    Rockpool Bar & Grill is the place to come for some of the world's best meat and seafood, with prime produce rigorously sourced and lovingly handled to create some truly spectacular dishes.
     
     
    Rockpool employs its own on-site butcher, who expertly ages whole sides of beef for 14 to 27 days to enhance the flavour and encourage a melt-in-the-mouth texture that has to be tasted to be believed. Wagyu beef sourced from a top Victorian producer is considered on a par to that found in Japan. Other dishes include whole abalone, wood-fired tuna, King Island chicken and fresh lobster.
     
     
    The candle-lit space accommodates 250 diners, with a private dining room, outdoor terrace and bar with separate casual menu.

    Ros McArthur Art Studio is located in the large garden of Woollahra sheep farm in the Victoria Valley, an area known for its production of ultra-fine merino wool. The property is circled by the Grampians mountain ranges and National Park that are a never-ending source of beauty and inspiration.
     
     
    The garden, a mixture of native and exotic plantings, supplies the material for still life paintings. Visitors are invited to wander and enjoy the garden. It has been designed to incorporate and blend with the natural surroundings and picturesque farming land.
     
     
    Many travellers tour the Great Ocean Road and then head north to the majesty of the mountains, a round trip from Melbourne. The studio is conveniently located to the north of Dunkeld and to the south of Halls Gap. There are prominent road signs from both directions.
     
     
    For Ros, painting is her passion and her form of expression in which to escape and explore visually and mentally. Her aim is to create images that please and challenge the senses.
     
     
    Oil paintings are available on canvas, stretched canvas and board, both framed and unframed. There is also a limited range of prints of popular works.  Ros is happy to discuss commissions.

    Where the View is Worth the Drive. 
     
     
    This is a truly beautiful public golf course with views that stretch from Port Phillip Bay to Bass Strait.
    The course was opened in 1956 on Crown Land and has well grassed and watered fairways, challenging greens and well placed bunkers. Excellent use has been made of the hillside location with a relatively flat front 9 holes and a more demanding back 9 holes.  
    
     
    This is a quality golf course at a very low price - every day! 
     
    Rosebud Park welcomes the casual and experienced golfer and guarantees good all-year-round playing conditions. Bookings for golf at weekends are essential.
     
    Modern and free undercover picnic facilities with electric barbecues and picnic tables have been provided for social groups and picnic parties. A short but informative and easy environmental bush walk has also been developed adjacent to the golf course and is worth a look.

    Roundstone is one of the picturesque smaller vineyards that make a tour through the gently rolling hills of the Yarra Valley so interesting. A big part of the approach here is to make wines that are appropriate to good food, and to that end proprietors John and Lynne Derwin operate a smart restaurant with Lynne as chef. The wines employ the usual Yarra varieties with Pinot Noir and Chardonnay being specialities. John is the winemaker with advice coming from Rob Dolan, who knows the region so well.

We have been consistently awarded 4-5 star ratings by James Halliday. Explorers Burke and Wills travelled past the property en route to Swan Hill on the first leg of their ill fated journey in August 1861. 
    
     
    
    Our family, boutique vineyard, produces Shiraz, Riesling, Merlot and sparkling white made from 100per cent pinot. Special feature of this vineyard include original stone fences, fantastic views of the McCarg Ranges and an old garden. 
    
     
    
    Our Riesling has won several awards at wine shows including rating over the past years between 93 and 95 by James Halliday. Our shiraz has won awards at various shows and will soon be exported to boutique market in the US. The sparkling blanc de noir is made from 100per cent pinot and has been one of our most popular wines over recent years. 
    
     
    
    First plantings occurred in 1995. The heavy red soils (terra rossa) hold moisture and the volcanic outcrops develop white peppery characteristic in the red wines, whilst the cool nights and slow ripening period produce rich full fruit flavours. The key to our wines begins in the vineyard with hand pruning, minimal to zero use of chemicals and meticulous selection of ripe rich berries for winemaking. 
    
     
    
    All wines are handpicked and made using traditional techniques which include gentle crushing, open vat fermentation, and basket pressing, followed by maturation in oak barrels. 
    
     
    
    You will find our wines available at many local outlets around the Daylesford Macedon Ranges wine region. We are also proud sponsors of the Redstich Actors Theatre in Chapel Street, St Kilda, and Melbourne, where our wines are available at performances.

    The Salus Day Spa was voted Australia's Best Spa/Health Retreat in the Gourmet Traveller Travel Awards. The boutique spa is nestled amongst the lush gardens of the Lake House hotel - which also includes an award winning restaurant.  
    
     
    
    The state-of-the-art Spa designed with blond wood and splashes of Tiffany blue, is surrounded by waterfall fed streams and offers nine treatment areas over three levels.
     
     
    Start with a hot mineral water spa. The deep tub is prepared with 100% pure mineral water from a specially selected nearby spring. Guests sit shoulder deep in the effervescant water and look out through the treetops to the lake shore below.
     
     
    Next try a massage - relaxation, deep tissue or perhaps remedial with one of the exceptional therapists.
     
     
    Indulge in a blissful Elemis treatment - an advanced performance facial, lime & ginger salt exfoliation or body wrap in the unique thermal steam and vichy cocoon. 
    
     
    
    The Hydrostorm is a perfect treatment for two people to share - incorporating vertical vichy, swiss shower, colour therapy, steam and aromatherapy.
     
     
    Large expanses of glass offer views to the lake shore, stream and cool fern gully. Outdoor balconies and sunlit lounges provide a lovely setting to enjoy a selection of spa cuisine and herbal teas. 
    
     
    
    In a region that boasts the largest concentration of naturally occurring mineral springs in Australia, Lake House Salus Mineral and Spring Water is available for guests to drink on site.
     
     
    When I first moved to Melbourne I was often told, 'you must go to Lake House'. I didn't ask why, because I like to be surprised. So I went, and surprised I was. Captivated actually! Quite naively, I'd pictured a house on a lake. But the Lake House, with its European ambience and Australian character, was much more than that.

    Samson Hill Winery and Vineyard at Kangaroo Ground, 28 kilometres north east of Melbourne CBD, was established in 1998 on a spectacular location overlooking the City of Melbourne, the surrounding mountains to Kinglake, the Dandenong's and much more. 
     
     
    The views are second to none and the clean air is plentiful. The concept of the founding family was to strive for quality only and develop full bodied rich reds and crisp fruity whites. Wines that can be enjoyed immediately but may also be kept in cellar for many years and would mature beautifully. 
     
     
    The varieties grown on the property are, Shiraz, Pinot Noir and Verdelho. From these the founders have produced a full bodied Shiraz, a bold Pinot Noir, a delicate Rose and two varieties from the Verdhelo - a sweet and a dry, both with the same bold fruity, floral nose and crisp melon characters ( very popular). 
     
     
    The Cellar door is open for free tastings daily and meals are also available. The staff are friendly and only too willing to chat about the wine or recommend other places of interest for tourists.

    Heathcote - Home of Shiraz 
    
    
     
     
    Heathcote is one of Australia's finest producers of Shiraz.  Located 90 minutes north of Melbourne, this historic town in the heart of Victoria is famous for its full-bodied yet smooth Shiraz wines; uniquely deep in colour and flavour.
     
     
    The secret is the 510 million year old Cambrian earth, found along an ancient land fault running through Heathcote.  This deep red soil brings a character to the landscape and wine unlike anywhere in the world.
     
     
    Sanguine Estate Wines 
    
    
     
     
    Sanguine (Sang-gwin): 1. Confident; popular; optimistic. 2. Red
     
     
    Established in 1997, Sanguine Estate has quickly forged a reputation for its intensely fruit driven and wonderfully complex Shiraz. The inaugural 2000 vintage, described as a 'fruit bomb' by one reviewer, was universally embraced by lovers of fine wine, selling out in less than one week.  The subsequent vintages have been received with even greater acclaim.
     
     
    World renown wine writers, James Halliday and Robert Parker Junior have rated Sanguine very highly, the former describing the 2001 Shiraz as: opulently-textured, full-bodied, rich, dense boasting great ripeness as well as purity
     
     
    The unique Heathcote climate and soil, and a viticultural philosophy of hand nurturing low yielding vines, combines to create Shiraz of the finest quality and complexity.
     
     
    The Hunter Family 
    
    
     
     
    From the moment we laid eyes on the land, we knew we'd discovered something special.
     
     
    That something special was rich undulating fields in the shadows of Mt Ida, Heathcote, Central Victoria. Tony and Linda Hunter's vision was to create a family-run boutique vineyard where quality, passion and energy were reflected in the wine. Embraced by children Mark and Jodi and their respective partners Melissa and Brett, Sanguine Estate has expanded from 16 acres to 55 acres in just five years.
     
     
    Cellar door is by appointment only and while stocks last.

    Set behind a playing fountain in a beautiful two-storey country house, Sault gives visitors the impression they are deep within the heart of rural France. It's only when a kangaroo bounds into sight across a distant paddock that you realise you're well and truly in Australia.
     
     
    Taking its name from a French town famed for its lavender, Sault is also a working lavender farm and distillery sitting amidst acres of lavender and overlooking its' own lake.
     
     
    Sault's cuisine is inspired by the abundance of rich local produce. Depending on the season, it might include main courses such as Hopkins River eye fillet or one of our wonderful tasting plates of house made pate, terrine, local meats from Istra, cheese from Holy Goat and house pickled vegetables and olives.
     
     
    All seasonal menus are available for perusal on our website.
     
     
    An extensive wine list showcases Australian and New Zealand labels along with great local wines such as Curly Flat, Pondalowie and Tom Boy Hill.
     
     
    On warm weekends, enjoy brunch, lunch or afternoon tea on the balcony while relishing the peace of this lovely slice of countryside. Or stay for dinner with a warming wine in front of the fire.
     
     
    To take home choose from Sault's own packaged range of salts, made on the premises by Tim Austin and his team including Za'arta which is showcased on the menu. Or perhaps try their popular quince past, elderberry jam, tomato jam and fig jam.
     
     
    Before you leave, you can purchase our very own lavender oil and lavender lip balm both made at Sault.

    Six years ago, after 25 years' experience in the dive industry, Peter Fear sold his successful Dive Victoria charter operation in Portsea, and opened a semi-retirement business up the road in an out-of-the-way part of Rye. Servicing and testing, that's all we were going to do, but it got out of hand, he says. The place just grew! 
    
     
    
    With all those years of passion and knowledge behind him, before too long Peter found himself picking up distributorships for top international dive-equipment brands such as Northern Diver, OMS and Miflex. Then, the opportunity for a virtual shop came up - it's now Australia's largest online dive store. 
    
     
    
    For those in the know, The Scuba Doctor is the place to go on the Mornington Peninsula for dive equipment hire, sales and service, and the best advice. An extensive range of top-quality gear is hand-picked by Peter, and made available at very reasonable prices. 
    
     
    
    A comprehensive range of equipment service and repairs is also offered at very competitive prices, (tank refills from just AUD5). There's quick turnaround to boot: a dive weekend doesn't have to be cut short thanks to The Scuba Doctor's emergency repair service and same-day cylinder testing. But emergency or not, this dive store is conveniently open seven days a week, including from 7.30am on weekends and public holidays - exactly when divers need Peter and his team on hand. 
    
     
    
    The Scuba Doctor organises regular interstate and international dive holidays, but there are good times to be had by simply visiting the store, where the lounge attracts divers kicking back between dips. Although few could relate as many good diver yarns and tips as Peter, who's been in the business for three decades. Drop in, and be greeted by Sadie, the friendly little dog in residence.

    For more than 150 years, Seppelt has been a leader in Australian Winemaking.  From the early days in the Barossa Valley in 1851, through to the purchase of the Great Western winery in 1918, to the present.  Seppelt has been an engine driving the Australian wine industry forward with a spirit of innovation and dedication to quality.
     
     
    Seppelt proudly presents one of the most versatile portfolios of any winery.  A complete showcase of wines spanning sparkling, table and fortified styles, combining an old world pedigree with the new world vision of our winemakers.  Great Western, and its world famous Drives, are the home of sparkling and table wine production.
     
     
    This diverse range of classics includes such iconic wines as Seppelt Salinger Pinot Noir Chardonnay, Great Western Show Sparkling Shiraz and St Peters Great Western Shiraz.
     
     
    Great Western Winery was established in 1865, and in 1868 more than 1.5 kms of underground tunnels were dug by miners for sparkling wine maturation, known as Drives.  Once completed in 1932 the Drives reached 3 km in length.

    When Dr Peter Mc Mahon planted the first vines at Seville Estate in 1972, it marked the rebirth of the Yarra Valley as a premium wine region. By the end of the decade Dr McMahon and his wife Margaret, along with producers such as Mount Mary, Yeringberg, Yarra Yering, St Huberts and the like were fashioning wines that served to re-establish the lofty reputation the Yarra Valley had enjoyed in the 19th century.
     
     
    From its first vintage, Seville Estate quickly established itself as one of the Yarra Valley's finest producers. Surprisingly in a region more renowned for its red wines produced from Cabernet and Pinot Noir, it was the Seville Estate Shiraz that received the most attention, quickly becoming one of Victoria's most sought after wines. These wines that have been called one of Victoria's best kept secrets are now some of the most stylish on the market, with back vintage tastings showing their superb ageing capacity.
     
     
    A new generation of the McMahon family has also become involved in Seville Estate. Peter and Margaret's grandson, Dylan is now the winemaker, following the passion ignited a generation before. The Seville style focuses on elegance and finesse, while showing fantastic complexity and structure. They are cool climate classics that stay true to the vineyard and vintage influences.
     
     
    Today 35 years after Peter and Margaret started the dream; Seville Estate enters its third phase.
     
     
    Graham and Margaret Van Der Meulen purchased the property in December 2005. They are fully hands-on in the vineyard, winery, and cellar door and plan to continue Seville's long-established record of producing consistently high quality wines.
     
     
    Seville Estate continues to produce wines that are simply Yarra Classics. Wines you can be proud to serve with a confidence that is borne of history and passion.

    The Shepparton Art Gallery was established in 1936 with a fifty pound grant from the State Government. Sir John Longstaff, a well known artist, and Robert D. Elliot were instrumental in securing the initial money and Longstaff became advisor to the Council on acquisitions. The first work purchased for the collection was 'A Wet Day at Tallarook' by John Rowell. By 1949 the collection totaled 37 works and was displayed in the Town Hall. The policy aimed to secure a historical selection of Australian Art with a few European paintings.
    
    By 1960 the collection was one of the few left in regional Victoria that lacked a purpose built gallery. With the redevelopment of the Civic Centre in 1965, a gallery was incorporated. Significant changes took place in the 1970s with decorative arts and crafts featuring as the main collecting area. The creation of a State Government Ministry for the Arts saw an increase in funding to the gallery.
    The present building was completed in 2001 with funding from the Federal Government, through the Federation Fund.

    Hinduism is the oldest living religion in the world. It dates back more than 6000 years when Hindu philosophies and a way of worship for Divine realisation were propounded in India. Hindu temples are usually majestic structures with ornamental spires (Gopurams) soaring into sky at the main entrances, and elaborately decorated halls. 
    
     
    
    The temple at Carrum Downs is a culmination of years of planning by the Hindu Society of Victoria, a skilled team of Indian artisans and a dedicated army of volunteers. The temple adroitly combines classical Hindu traditions with construction practices in Australia. Presently the Society has undertaken another ambitious project in the construction of multi-million dollar Cultural Centre. 
    
     
    
    Temple Worship 
    
     
    
    There are 32 deities worshipped in the temple from various Hindu traditions.  Some of them are described below: 
    
     
    
        * Ganapathy - Traditionally worshipped as remover of obstacles 
    
        * Shiva - The 'lingam', a rounded, featureless, pillar, represents the formless reality of Divinity 
    
        * Vishnu - Represents the divine power of sustenance

The Hindu Society participates in inter-faith dialogue, and members of all faiths are welcome to visit the temple. 
    
     
    
    A canteen facility serving vegetarian snacks, food and drinks is open during Friday evenings, and weekends.

    Melbourne's most recognisable landmark, the Shrine of Remembrance, was built between July 1928 and November 1934 in remembrance of those 114,000 men and women of Victoria who served and those who died in the Great War of 1914-1918.
     
     
    A special feature of the Shrine is the Ray of Light. Thanks to combined skills of an astronomer, a mathematician and a surveyor the Ray of Light falls on the word LOVE on sacred the Stone of Remembrance at 11am on the 11th of November and will continue to do so for 5,000 years at least.
     
     
    The time and date mark the anniversary of the end of hostilities in the Great War by what was called the Armistice. Simulated Ray of Light services of remembrance are held for visitors every half hour.
     
     
    After World War II a Memorial Forecourt in the shape of a cross of sacrifice was added and this included three flagpoles, the Eternal Flame and the Cenotaph.
     
     
    A water garden, known as Remembrance Garden, on the western slope of the Shrine grounds commemorates post 1945 armed conflicts such as Malaya, Borneo, Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait, Balkans, Cambodia, Somalia and East Timor.
     
     
    Today, the Shrine of Remembrance draws thousands of visitors each year - to remember, to contemplate, or to simply visit as tourists.
     
     
    There is a Visitor Centre and Education Centre providing visitors of all ages with a comprehensive experience. Trustees are very active in encouraging schools to visit the Shrine so that the next generation of Australians learn something of the traditions of the armed services and the significance of remembrance.
     
     
    Over 90 voluntary guides give up their time to conduct guided tours of the Shrine on a daily basis.
     
     
    Please visit our website for more information for upcoming exhibitions and events.

    Italian emigres Patrizia Simone and her husband George run one of country Victoria's most celebrated restaurants - the legendary Simone's. Housed in a warm and welcoming converted house bedecked with Simone family photographs, the restaurant serves up flavour-packed dishes that owe as much to chef Patrizia's Perugian heritage as they do to the fresh produce of north-east Victoria.
    Simone's has helped put the picturesque alpine town of Bright on the map, and Patrizia is personally credited with putting the entire region on the gastronomic radar. The seasonal menu changes frequently and may feature local rabbit, Rutherglen lamb or carefully stuffed zucchini flowers.
     
    This is Italian comfort food but beautifully finessed and with real, authentic flavours. After 20 years in Bright, Simone's is still as good as ever and a visit here is a window to Australia's proud immigrant heritage.

    Food ethics, community and lifestyle are what Slow Living is all about. Almost everything sold in the cafe and store is organic or biodynamic. We enjoy nothing better than a field trip to our local farmers to see what's been freshly picked.

In summer, a refreshing menu features vine ripened heirloom tomatoes, freshly picked greens, locally produced smallgoods, organic goats cheese, olives and our own Slow Living relish.
     
     
    There's always a daily specials board with a feast of continually changing delights on offer. Breakfast is served all week and features homemade toasted muesli, wood fired sourdough, fresh free-range eggs, and locally produced, rare breed Wessex Saddleback bacon.

    Things to Do:
    
         
    * McKillop Bridge is one of the few places in the park with access to the Snowy River by conventional vehicle. The Deddick River meets the Snowy just upstream of the bridge and wide sandy beaches with shallow rock pools between the rapids make this a great swimming spot.
         
    * This is also the best canoe-launching place for adventurers wanting to explore the gorges downstream. The Snowy offers thrilling canoeing or rafting with rugged gorges, rapids, flat sections with sand bars and beautiful scenery. The gently sloping sand bars make ideal camp sites. 
         
    * The 18 km Silver Mine Walking Track and the short Snowy River Trail both leave from McKillop Bridge.
         
    * Little River Gorge, Victoria's deepest gorge, is to the west of McKillop Bridge and downstream from the junction of the Little River and Snowy River. 
         
    * In suitable conditions, visitors can drive along the Yalmy Road through magnificent tall forests to Waratah Flat, then walk through the surrounding forest. Raymond Falls in the south of the park can be reached all year round from Orbost along Moresford Track. A short walking track leads to a view of Raymond Falls plunging 20 metres into a deep, clear pool. McKillop Bridge is the finishing point for the Deddick Trail, a 43 km four-wheel drive track which starts on the Yalmy Road and travels through the heart of the park. Camping grounds are provided on the banks of the Snowy and Deddick.
         
    * Fishing in the Snowy River can be disappointing, but tributaries often have good trout.
    
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Step back in time and experience Australia's exciting goldrush days at Sovereign Hill. Set on a former goldmining site, this award winning outdoor museum recreates in fascinating detail the hustle and bustle of life in the 1850s. There is so much to do and see.
     
     
    In the diggings you can pan for REAL gold! Witness AUD50,000 of molten gold being poured into a bullion bar at Sovereign Hill's Goldpour.
     
     
    Go 13 metres underground on a tour of the Red Hill Mine, which uses life-size, moving holograms to reincarnate battling Cornish miner, Richard Jeffrey as he stumbles on what was the biggest gold nugget ever found, the Welcome Nugget - at 69 kilograms, still the second largest nugget in the world.
     
     
    Sovereign Hill's Main Street is busy with people in colourful costumes and horse-drawn vehicles. Craftsmen are at work throughout the township, with a variety of shops and businesses open to purchase goods - grocers, candle maker, blacksmith and jewellers to name a few.
     
     
    At the Hope Bakery, pastry cakes and breads are freshly baked each day in the wood-fired brick oven. You can play bowls, be photographed in Victorian costume, enjoy live street performances and ride in horse drawn coaches.
     
     
    At night, Sovereign Hill stages the spectacular sound and light show Blood on the Southern Cross, which tells the story of Australia's only civil uprising - the Eureka Rebellion of 1854.
     
     
    Across the road from Sovereign Hill is the Gold Museum which houses an extensive and valuable collection of gold nuggets, alluvial deposits, gold ornaments and coins.
     
     
    Beyond the gold experience, you can also explore a series of galleries offering new and fascinating exhibitions drawn from the Gold Museum's extensive collections, along with a number of touring exhibitions.

    The official opening of the SS&A Wodonga clubhouse was in November 2007. The clubhouse underwent a complete refit and emerged from the refurbishment as a stylish, contemporary clubhouse that is enjoyed by locals and visitors alike. 
    
     
    
    The 18 hole Kevin Hartley designed course is generally flat but there are plenty of water hazards, sand traps and native timber to ensure you will pay for any wayward shots. The course is undergoing extensive upgrading which is an ongoing commitment and the course is being hailed as one of the best in the North East of Victoria. 
    
     
    
    Each December the Murray Masters Pro Am is held at four courses in this region and the touring professionals have been impressed with the standard of the course, facilities and the friendly, professional service that they receive. 
    
     
    
    At SS&A Wodonga you can have lessons with three PGA Professionals in the Pro Shop and they have Golf Carts for hire as well as a fully stocked shop for all of your accessories. The clubhouse is fully licensed, has a restaurant operating seven days a week, a kids play area, lounge and balcony settings and is great for singles, couples or groups. 
    
     
    
    This region is punctuated with spectacular scenery, the Murray River, the Rutherglen Wineries and lots of history. You can revisit the past at Beechworth with Ned Kelly, Corowa is the birthplace of Federation, Mad Dan Morgan ruled the roads at Walla Walla and beyond and the peaks and valleys of the region are a day trippers delight. 
    
     
    
    The various food & wine trails are earmarked with fresh, local product and the Rutherglen Wineries are renowned for their fortified wines. If you love golf and a laid back, friendly liferstyle then we look forward to seeing you soon.

    The modern St.Huberts estate is the reincarnation of one of Victoria's most famous and historic vineyard properties. 120 years ago St.Huberts' wines were the toast of the colony, winning awards internationally, as well as mightily pleasing the grandees back home. 
     
     
    Today's St.Huberts was one of the properties that launched the Yarra Valley's second golden age in the 1960s, and the wines continue to be good examples of regional styles. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon are the stars here; don't miss them. Ralph Kyte-Powell

    Providing panoramic views of the Melbourne skyline and Port Phillip Bay, the pier is a popular destination for strolling, cycling, roller blading and fishing. Catch a ferry to Williamstown, enjoy a snack at the kiosk or try to spot the penguins and native water rats from the breakwater. Whatever your preference, St Kilda Pier provides an unforgettable experience right in the heart of Melbourne.
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    St Kilda Pier has been the centre of recreational activity in St Kilda since the 1850's. Both the old shed at the pier entrance and the pavilion at the end are part of Victoria's heritage.
     
     
    St Kilda Pier's history dates back to 1853 when the St Kilda Pier and Jetty Company constructed a wooden jetty to assist the early settlers in unloading timber, building materials and firewood to St Kilda. Not long after its construction the small jetty fell victim to a stormy Port Phillip Bay and was washed away. Various forms of piers were constructed at St Kilda in the 1800's as the demand for a larger pier grew with the ever-increasing trade to and from the area. Since then the St Kilda Pier has grown to its present size, with the most recent concrete section constructed in the 1970's.
     
     
    The historic St Kilda Pier Kiosk was built in 1904 and has undergone several renovations in its time. Tragically, the Kiosk was devastated by fire on September 11, 2003.

    This is a wonderful small winery that tends to be a bit of a microcosm for what Rutherglen does best. The fortifieds, naturally, are brilliant and the Durif, which is grown virtually nowhere else in the world, is a huge, tannic but beautifully made wine. The Stanton and Killeen Vintage Port is legendary and near enough to perfect. Ben Canaider

    In its heyday, the State Coal Mine was a bustling network of tunnels, filled with men and pit ponies, dust and dim lights. Deep below the surface, miners toiled to dig the valuable black coal which powered Victoria's railway network. The mine was Wonthaggi's life-blood, and was active from 1909 to 1968. 
    
     
    
    Underground Tours 
    
    Limited underground tours are now available (conditions and fees apply). 
    
    Please phone 03 5672 3053 for further details and booking enquiries. 
    
    All underground tours are guided by Parks Victoria staff and volunteers, who tell stories from mining days past, and explain mining methods and social history. Many guides have personal connections to the mine, with a special few being retired miners. 
    
     
    
    This authentic mine gives visitors the opportunity to experience the primitive conditions of black coal mining in Victoria during the 1900's.  The mine remains just as it was in its working days. Tools and equipment are still in place, as if the miners have just walked away. 
    
     
    
    All that's missing are the men and pit-ponies. But, if you stand still you can almost hear the clatter of horse shoes on steel rails, rumbling skips and the tapping of pick on coal. 
    
     
    
     Things to Do - There's plenty to do above ground too!  
    
    - Relax in the theatrette as historic film brings Wonthaggi's mining heritage to life.   
    
    - Follow the heritage walk around the mine site, exploring historic buildings housing, photographs of mining days past and mining remnants.   
    
    - Climb aboard the K192 steam locomotive which utilised Wonthaggi's coal to operate.  
    
    - Meet Cobber the Pit Pony. 
    
     
    
    Facilities:    
    
    - Ample car and bus parking.   
    
    - Sheltered picnic area and free barbecues.  
    
    - Souvenir shop with light refreshments available.   
    
    - Access for visitors with limited mobility.

    One of the world's great libraries, the State Library of Victoria is the state's premier reference and research library and a gateway to the world's information. The Library houses items that showcase Victoria's cultural life, past and present, and makes them available to the community through a range of services, exhibitions and cultural programs.
     
     
    The State Library of Victoria was founded in 1854, largely through the efforts of a number of prominent Melbourne citizens such as Sir Redmond Barry and Lieutenant-Governor Charles Joseph La Trobe, the vision for the original library was ambitious - to contain the 'best of everything' and become 'a great emporium of learning and philosophy, of literature, science, and art'.
     
     
    The Library's collection goes well beyond books. It holds thousands of significant items reflecting Victoria's cultural and social heritage, including historical documents such as John Batman's journal, unique objects such as Ned Kelly's armour, and paintings such as William Strutt's Black Thursday, February 6th, 1851.
     
     
    The balconies encircling the beautiful Domed Reading Room have now been transformed into exhibition areas. The Dome Gallery houses the changing face of Victoria, an exhibition with an ever-changing display of pictures, manuscripts, maps and objects ranging from key historical artefacts to items from daily life. This fascinating exhibition features subjects such as the early years of European settlement, bushranger Ned Kelly, Marvellous Melbourne, Barak and Coranderrk, and some of the Library's more eclectic collections.
     
     
    The second Dome exhibition, Mirror of the World: books and ideas, showcases many of the rare, beautiful and historically significant books held in the collections of the State Library. Mirror of the World celebrates books as keepers of ideas, knowledge and the imagination, as well as our special relationship with them as writers and readers.

    Steels Creek is a small winery sourcing fruit from only 1.7 hectares of vines. Despite their size, the red wines are made on site by Simon Peirce and the white wines made with assistance from consultants.
     
     
    The Cabernet Sauvignon has been a successful wine, even in 1996 which was a difficult year to ripen the grapes. A spicy and peppery Shiraz is gaining popularity together with the Co Lombard which is a unique varietal for the Yarra Valley. Stuart Gregor

    Steiglitz, situated between Geelong and Ballarat, is almost a ghost town today, but in the 1860's and 1890's it was a busy goldmining township with hotels, shops, churches and a population of over 1,000.
     
     
    At the height of the 1860's gold rush, Steiglitz township had more than 1,500 residents, 4 hotels, a newspaper, a variety of shops and even an undertaker. Now most of the town and its surroundings are included in the 469ha Steiglitz Historic Park, declared in 1979. Images of Steiglitz in its boom years are displayed in the historic Court House, open Sundays and public holidays.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
         
    * Much of the park can be explored on foot. Try the Discovering Old Steiglitz self-guided walk described in a parknote available at Steiglitz. Walks along bush tracks in spring reveal a variety of wildflowers.
         
    * There are many pleasant picnic spots around Steiglitz. Toilets and water are available at the Bert Boardman Recreation Area
         
    * Explore the surrounding bush for evidence of mining. However, beware of mine shafts and please don't remove any relics you find
         
    * The cemetery on the Maude-Steiglitz Road is worth a visit if you're interested in history
         
    * During some holiday periods, the rangers organise guided walks and other activities
         
    * Note that gold panning is permitted only in the section one kilometre downstream from the Meredith Road bridge on Sutherlands Creek. Prospectors are permitted to use pans, cradles and hand tools within the creek-bed. Please protect the creek-bank environment. A miner's right is required
    
     
     
    Precautions
     
     
    Historic mines dot the landscape around the township of Steiglitz. Many of these are now overrun with vegetation and as such are hard to find. Visitors need to be careful when walking and remain on walking trails and management tracks.

    The Sticks cellar door, situated in the heart of the Yarra Valley, offers the visitor a myriad of experiences. Enjoy tasting the full range of award winning Sticks wines with our friendly staff, pick up a bottle of our cellar door only specials, browse our local produce on sale, view the works of our  artist of the month  or simply relax by the fire with a glass of Sticks and enjoy the view.  You may even bumb into the  infamous  Rob  Sticks  Dolan for a glass or two!
     
     
    The Sticks story begins with Rob 'Sticks' Dolan, the founding winemaker, who had the nickname Sticks bestowed on him during his days as the ruckman for Aussie Rules Football team Port Adelaide and standing at 6 foot 6, it is rather apt.   Having established a reputation as one of the Yarra Valley s leading winemakers, Rob has pulled together a young, vibrant and highly regarded winemaking team who are as serious about the  sticks  in the vineyard as Rob is about his footy.
     
     
    Now into its seventh vintage, Sticks is recognised as a leading producer of quality Yarra Valley wines that offer supreme value for money.  The Sticks style is one of unique, fruit driven and imminently fresh wines that marry beautifully with food.
     
     
    And despite working hard, the Sticks team will always find time for the Aussie Rules footy season, hence the Sticks Footy Tipping Competition best played from www.sticks.com.au  with a glass of Sticks in your hand!
     
     
    We look forward to seeing you very soon.

    Heritage
     
     
    Sugarloaf Reservoir was developed during the late 1970's to help supplement Melbourne's domestic water supply. Unlike many other Reservoirs, which draw their water directly from protected forested catchments, Sugarloaf is fed by the Maroondah Aqueduct and the Yarra River. Upon leaving the Reservoir, water is thoroughly treated at the Winneke Water Treatment Plant to World Health Organisation Guidelines, before reaching Melbourne's domestic water supply.

    Sutherland Estate is a family-owned, boutique enterprise in the heart of the premium, cool climate wine growing region of the Yarra Valley.  
    
     
    
    Our property consists of 110 acres, which is mostly undisturbed native bushland. The hill on the northern end of the property, upon which our cellar door is built, is known as Daniel s Hill.    
    
     
    
    We have four small vineyard blocks totalling approximately 12 acres, with the original block planted in 1995. Varieties planted include Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, with small parcels of Gew rztraminer and Tempranillo.  
    
     
    
    Most vineyard management is carried out by hand to ensure the highest quality fruit. This includes hand pruning, bunch thinning, leaf plucking and early morning hand-picking.    
    
     
    
    The cool climate of our site (and the Yarra in general) provides a longer than usual ripening season, which in turn produces wines of varietal intensity, together with complexity and elegance.    
    
     
    
    Sutherland Estate is committed to producing the highest quality wines of true regional character.    
    
     
    
    We have two ranges, being the Varietal and the DHV (Daniel s Hill Vineyard) range. The DHV is produced exclusively from the old  D  block on the estate. Our wines have received immediate acclaim with our first entry into James Halliday's 2005 Wine Companion.    
    
     
    
    Our cellar door is a relaxing, wonderful place to enjoy a glass of wine and a platter of Yarra Valley cheeses. It was designed and built by ourselves onto the side of Daniel s Hill on the northern side of the property. It enjoys panoramic views across the Yarra Valley to the Dandenong s and Warburton Ranges.    
    
     
    
    The cellar door is a large, graceful room with an 11m vaulted ceiling, rising to a stunning glass prism. The huge windows take advantage of the Valley s views as does the spacious wooden deck. A large, open fire warms in winter. The cellar door is available for your exclusive, private function.

    Heritage
     
     
    Members of the Wurundjeri tribe of Aboriginals originally inhabited the area. The area remains significant to descendants of the Wurundjeri. During the 1840's, the land around Sweeneys Flats was purchased by Thomas Sweeney, a former convict who established an extensive property built by hard work and initiative. The Hawthorn hedge that remains is still a small part of what was once a system of many hedgerows separating the paddocks of the property from one another.
     
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * Take your rubbish home
     
    * Dogs and other pets are not permitted in the park
     
    * Leave the park as you find 
     
    * All native plants and animals are protected

    T'Gallant is the funkiest winery on the Peninsula. The cellar door always offers something new and unusual, the wines are always different but beautifully made, the labels are quite crazy and the restaurant La Baracca always seems to have something exciting going on. This is an innovative and often brilliant place and you must try their Tribute Pinot Gris

    Taltarni is a family name to most wine drinkers; It's been part of the Victorian wine scenery for 25 years, but in case you hadn't noticed, it's been undergoing something of a rebirth lately...
     
     
    Taltarni's wines have reversed direction to a gentler, more fruit-driven style than ever before. Bravo! - The 2001 Taltarni Pyrenees Shiraz is a good example...The new flagship red, Cephas launched last year, is a shiraz cabernet sourced from the best blocks of the vineyard. The 2001 is an elegant red with anise, perfumed oak and ripe-berry aromas: a stylish refined, intensely flavoured red that should cellar well... Huon Hooke - May 2004
     
     
    Set amidst the relaxed and friendly ambience of Taltarni cellar door and surrounded by beautiful gardens and scenic vineyards, Red Earth Cafe provides another great opportunity for you to enjoy our wines, food and hospitality. Together with a diverse programme of special events throughtout the year such as the Taltarni Cup Recovery Day (in October) and Taltarni Imperial Long Lunch on May 1, Taltarni vineyards is your next great getaway destination.

    The picnic area has sloping lawns set amongst bush settings, with unique views of the reservoir and surrounding landscapes. Whether you have come for a family get-together, relaxing or just a walk, you are sure to find a special area that caters to your needs.
     
     
    Things to see and do
     
     
    Discover the beautiful walking path at the bottom of the dam wall. The walk winds its way through a damp valley, which is home to eucalypts and tree ferns over two hundered years old. Notice the thinner trees at the top of the valley, regenerating from a fire that skipped over the trees lower in the valley, explaining the differences in size.
     
     
    Visitors with disabilities are catered for in the park. Ramps are provided to all facilities, however, entrance to the ramps is at the far end of the park. The walking track has a number of small steps and may be unsuitable for wheel chair access.
     
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * Please note we do not permit heat bead or portable wood barbecues in the Park. Portable gas barbecues are permitted
     
    * On days of Total Fire Ban no barbecues are permitted
     
    * Dogs are permitted only if on a leash and under control of the owner
     
    * No access is permitted into the reservoir or surrounding area

    The TarraWarra Museum of Art is the first privately funded, significant public visual arts museum to be set up under the Australian Government's philanthropic measures announced in March 1999. TWMA operates as a not-for-profit institution, with a charter to display Australian art from the second half of the twentieth century to the present day.
     
     
    Eva and Marc Besen had long dreamt of sharing their inexhaustible passion for Australian art with the people of Australia and beyond. In 1999, the first steps were taken to make this dream a reality, with the formulation of a vision for a new museum in the Yarra Valley, with its own collection of Australian art chosen from their private collection that has been lovingly assembled over the last fifty years.
     
     
    In 2000, an architectural competition was conducted with five of Melbourne's most outstanding architects invited to present design schemes for the museum. Allan Powell's design for this elegant building, arcing gently from the earth in concert with the contours and hues of the landscape, was chosen.
     
     
    This realisation of Eva and Marc Besen's vision in their gift to the public, provides a retreat from the city and an opportunity to experience three of their enduring passions, Australian modern art, architecture and the beautiful Yarra Valley landscape.

    Tea Leaves has two outstanding shops for tea lovers.
     
     
    You will find our tourism award winning shop in Sassafras, a quaint mountain village in the scenic Dandenong Ranges. Our second shop is in Yarra Glen, a thriving little township in the heart of the Yarra Valley wine growing district.
     
     
    Both are often described as treasure chests crammed full of teas, teapots and tea accessories of every description and colour imaginable.
     
     
    Novelty teapots are our specialty.
     
     
    Tea Leaves offers over 300 teas, imported fresh from China, India, Sri Lanka, Japan, Africa, Indonesia and Australia, then blended and packaged in Sassafras, creating a blizzard of tastes, heavenly aromas and flavours for every occasion. Every tea type imaginable, white, green, black, oolong, organic, decaffeinated, compressed, flavoured teas and fruit blends from Germany, gourmet, classical, specialty and herbal blends.
     
     
    Owner Terry Abraham opened Tea Leaves in Sassafras, nine years ago, believing tea was beginning a popularity comeback. Revived consumer interest in tea drinking lead to the opening of an internet shop and a second retail shop in Yarra Glen.
     
     
    Terry is happy to answer any tea related questions from customers and has become an industry leader offering advice and information to all newcomers; some first time tea drinkers, some in the hospitality industry, all discovering tea for the first time.
     
     
    The key to distinctive tasting, quality tea is its second flush picking time and freshness. The best teas have an established reputation-Darjeeling, for example, is considered the champagne of teas. The range of tea varieties is such to invite comparisons with wine varieties.
     
     
    Tea drinking generates a refreshing and relaxing feeling and an increasing number of scientific studies are confirming the health benefits of tea drinking.
     
     
    Tea Leaves offers the largest range of premium quality teas and teawares for the best prices in Melbourne.

    James Halliday 2008 Australian Wine Companion 5 stars - Outstanding winery regularly producing wines of exemplary quality and typicity.
     
     
    Gourmet Traveller 2008 Australian Restaurant Guide This new operation is the best gastronomic outpost to have opened on the Mornington Peninsula in a long time. 
     
     
    Gourmet Traveller 2008 Wine List of the Year As well as the winery's offerings, this superbly designed document contains a mouthwatering selection of the world's best bottles and a staggering amount of background reading. 
     
     
    Ten Minutes by Tractor (TMBT) was formed in 1999 by three families, each of whom owned vineyards close to each other (in fact ten minutes by tractor apart) on Mornington Peninsula with an aim to produce wines that reflected the unique character of their vineyards. In 2004 TMBT was bought by Martin Spedding.
     
     
    The key focus of TMBT is unrelenting effort to grow the best fruit possible on our vineyards with meticulous care of our premium blocks. Our winemaking philosophy is to be non interventionist as possible and, for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, to utilise traditional Burgundian winemaking techniques that assist in producing the wonderful flavours, complexity, elegance and length which the wines of our region demonstrate.
     
     
    Ten Minutes By Tractor has 14ha of bearing vineyards, with average age of 16 years, including Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris and Tempranillo. The different vineyards - different locations, elevations and orientations - give us the opportunity of picking and vinifying grapes from each vineyard, in fact each block within each vineyard, separately.
     
     
    In our restaurant, chef Stuart Bell produces outstanding dishes, using high quality, local produce as much as possible, including herbs, salads and vegetables from our own kitchen garden. This provides an extra dimension for our customers to further extend the wine tasting experience with a wide range of superb dishes to match and enjoy with your favourite wines.

    Situated north of Bendigo, this park contains the most significant remaining area of the once extensive native grasslands of northern Victoria. It is home to many rare or threatened species such as Buloke mistletoe, Woolly Cloakfern, Bush Stone-curlews, Barking Owls and Greycrowned Babblers.
     
     
    Things to Do
     
     
    Nature lovers can enjoy the beautiful flora and fauna that are unique to the area.     Scenic drives take visitors to grasslands, granite outcrops, eucalypt woodlands and historical farming sites.
     
     
    Heritage  In November 1998, after celebrating 10 years as a state park, Terrick Terrick was declared a national park. The park is important in maintaining regional biodiversity, protecting significant landscape values and preserving important cultural and archeological features. The park will be managed to protect and restore the unique vegetation community while maintaining the sense of remoteness that attracts many people to the area.
     
     
    The declaration of Terrick Terrick as a national park was the direct result of the acquisition of a 1277 ha property adjacent to the park. This property contains the largest remnant of endangered northern plains grassland community, and is probably the largest area of high quality remnant grassland vegetation in Victoria. In addition, several species of national and state significance have been recorded here. The values of this property have been retained through a conservative sheep grazing regime with relatively light stocking rates.
     
     
    In October 2002, the park was expanded to 3,880ha with the passing of the Box-Ironbark Bill.

    To the south of Port Campbell, offshore in 20 metres of water, the limestone seafloor breaks up into a series of amazing canyons, arches and tunnels that are locally known as 'The Arches'. This area is typical of the southwest Victorian coast and exposed to high-energy waves and cool water that flows from the Southern Ocean.
     
     
    This 45 hectare marine sanctuary contains some of Victoria's most spectacular limestone formations and is home to a diverse array of marine plants and animals. Due to the shaded underside of the Arches, habitat is provided for invertebrate life that is characteristic of deeper Bass Strait waters and includes a diverse range of sponges, bryozoans, gorgonians, hydroids and an abundance of colourful seastars. Giant kelp forests also occur within the Marine Sanctuary.
     
     
    Things to Do

    A major attraction on the Mornington Peninsula is The Briars Park. 
     
     
    The Park is a beautiful example of 'Cultural Landscape', with a long history of Aboriginal occupation, followed by European occupation of one of the first pastoral 'runs' on the Mornington Peninsula, represented today by a complex of heritage listed farm buildings and gardens.  
     
     
    The Briars 1840s Homestead houses a world renowned collection of Napoleonic memorabilia, established by Dame Mabel Brookes to mark the relationship between her Grandfather William Balcombe and the Emperor Napoleon during the latter's exile on St Helena.
     
     
    While the original farm has been retained, 96 hectares was never cleared and now forms an important Wildlife Reserve, protected by a vermin proof fence.  
     
     
    Open woodland of manna gum and peppermint is being restocked with kangaroos and wallabies to join the resident koalas, which may be seen from the Woodland Walk.  Waterbirds can be viewed from the bird observation hides overlooking extensive wetlands.

Stuart Gregor.
     
     
    Our wines are made by Geoff just from the grapes which we grow on this site. We try to ensure that with high quality grapes and oak, using minimal intervention methods, we can produce small amounts of high quality, yet affordable wine. Pinot Noir and Chardonnary grow particularly well on our cool sun-drenched northerly slope.

    At the beautifully designed Eureka Centre commemorating the events of the 1854 Eureka Stockade, visitors can experience the tensions and the drama of December 1854 when Ballarat's diggers took up arms against a corrupt and unjust goldfields administration. After years of oppression, the bloody battle that followed led to the birth of true democracy in Australia.
     
     
    Visitors can move through a series of galleries that employ multimedia technology to vividly bring the Eureka story to life. The Contemplation Space allows visitors to rest and reflect on the significance of Eureka in Australia's history.
     
     
    The Centre has a cafe and a shop with a range of souvenirs, including Eureka-themed items. The Centre provides a full visitor information service.
     
     
    These 19th century Stockade Gardens pleasure gardens were set aside by the people of Ballarat in the 1870s to commemorate the Eureka Rebellion. Relax and take time to reflect among the mature trees, the 1880s bluestone monument, the all-abilities Eureka Playground and the Eureka Circle, erected in 2004 to commemorate Eureka 150. Toilets and barbecue facilities are available in the Gardens.

    Established in 1859, this is one of the few substantially intact provincial newspaper printeries remaining from the gold mining era.
     
     
    Just as the Chiltern area attracted gold prospectors, the first edition of the newspaper appeared on 24 August 1859.
     
     
    The first proprietors were Felix Ashworth, George Boyer, and George H Mott. Within two years the Federal Standard had incorporated Rutherglen s first newspaper, The Murray Gazette, Albury s first newspaper, The Border Post, and The Ovens Constitution at Beechworth. To carry out these tasks, large steam-driven printing machinery was installed capable of producing 2,000 impressions per hour.
     
     
    The papers published from this building were among the most influential in Victoria and the Riverina, with agencies as distant as London. George Henry Mott s influence was considerable in the printing business. Many men he employed established papers elsewhere. In a period of 112 years the Mott family owned and published some 45 newspapers either wholly or in partnership.
     
     
    When the building was purchased it had been used as a newspaper and jobbing printing office for over 110 years. The equipment in it was much as you see here today. It is a mixture of printing equipment from the 1870s through to the 1920s. In its heyday, up to five people would have worked under this unlined roof   a very hot workplace in Chiltern s warm summers and very cold on frosty midwinter days.
     
     
    The equipment includes two presses, a linotype machine and metal text and graphics in original typecases.

    The house and 'old world' garden at The Heights dates back to the 1850s. The house was erected in 1855 and is remarkable for being the largest (14 rooms) German, prefabricated house in Victoria.
     
     
    During the 1930s, the building was extensively altered to reflect contemporary taste although the extensive gardens, stables, outbuildings and water tower survive intact from the 19th century.
     
     
    The heights retains a small collection of fine Georgian furniture collected by the last owners, Louis and Marnie Whyte.
     
     
    Early 1860s plantings still dominate this beautiful Geelong garden today and the aged oaks and conifers provide great delight to visitors. Garden or self -guided garden walks are available.

    The Ian Potter Foundation Children s Garden, located at the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne, is a magical place for children to discover the world of plants.  
    
    The tourism award-winning Children s Garden is full of interesting and interactive places to play and explore including:
     
     
    The Meeting Place 
    
    Children should bring their swimming gear and be prepared to squeal with delight as water spouts from the ground.
     
     
    The Ruin Garden 
    
    This is a world of lush rainforest vegetation where children can scramble over and under rock, dig in the sand mulch and construct cubbies.
     
     
    The Wetland Area 
    
    A natural pond teeming with life and a place where children can experience insects and plants. Children can use tools such as nets, aquaspheres, microscopes and a library to take their learning further.
     
     
    The Bamboo Forest 
    
    A magical place where the entire space is defined by bamboo. When in the bamboo forest the qualities of light, sound and texture all change.
     
     
    The Gorge 
    
    Stepping stones lead visitors from the Meeting Place into the Gorge where children will be surrounded by large basalt shards and twisted Snow Gums. Mist periodically fills the space creating an atmosphere of mystery.
     
     
    Plant Tunnels 
    
    The plant tunnels are a place where children can run, hide and play.
     
     
    Children s Kitchen Garden 
    
    Children can get their hands dirty in the kitchen garden, an area that features interesting, unusual and common fruits, vegetables and herbs.
     
     
    The Rill 
    
    Patterned to resemble an old river, water flowing along the rill has its beginnings in the rainforest, meanders through the lawn, and flows into the wetland pond. This spot is a popular place for children to play  leaf  races.
     
     
    Tree Tower 
    
    A new feature of The Ian Potter Foundation Children s Garden is the Tree Tower. Climb it and see the Garden from up high!

    The Lakes National Park is a peaceful bushland retreat in the Gippsland Lakes, fringed by the waters of Lake Victoria and Lake Reeve. The park occupies 2,390 hectares of low-lying woodland and coastal heath, consisting of Sperm Whale Head peninsula, Rotamah and Little Rotamah Islands.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
         
    * Call into the park office in Loch Sport during office hours and view the information displays, exhibits and 'touch table'.

    A living part of Melbourne's modern Chinatown, the Chinese Museum was brought into being in 1985 to document, preserve and display the history of Australians of Chinese descent.
     
     
    An exciting range of changing
    exhibitions, heritage tours and public seminars are some of the ways by
    which the Museum shares the past, culture, and values of Australia's
    Chinese community. Artefacts dug from the Victorian goldfields,
    carpenters' tools from industrious furniture makers, and images of the
    debutante balls of the 1930's Young Chinese League, evoke some of the
    richness of the Chinese contribution to Australia's history.  
    
     
     
    The Museum is also home to Dai Loong and the Millennium Dragon, the largest Chinese dragon in the world.
     
     
    On the lower level of the Museum, Finding Gold replicates the experience of the Chinese in Australia's 19th century goldfields.
     
     
    During your visit you can also retrace the journey from Canton
    on a steamer and become immersed in the adventures of Chinese gold
    seekers through displays that include a winding deep lead mine and an
    elaborate goldfields diorama.
     
     
    Afterwards you can consult your fortune in the temple of Guan Gong
    (a famous Chinese general and deity), be entertained by Cantonese opera
    in a tent theatre, and see diggers double their winnings on the Chinese
    lottery.
     
     
    A highlight of the Museum is the
    costume collection, with traditional wedding clothes, shoes worn by
    women with bound feet and opera costumes all on display.
     
     
    The Chinese Museum is located in Melbourne's Chinatown
    - the oldest area of continuous Chinese settlement in the western world
    - to provide a focal point to the precinct's rich social and
    architectural heritage.

    The new Spanish Bar & Grill is a must-go dining experience for visitors to the Mildura region. 
    
     
    
    After two state awards for Best Steak Restaurant the sophisticated and yet reassuringly relaxed dining venue was awarded the 2009 Savour Australia Award for Excellence, as the Best Steak Restaurant in Australia. 
    
     
    
    Located with the historic Grand Hotel Mildura, the entrance is from Langtree Avenue, most of the year shaded by an age-old vine covered arbour. 
    
     
    
    The restaurant is a flexible space, with a range of wine related stacks, barrels and racks enabling the space to be re-configured for groups, while still retaining a sense of privacy. The raised banquettes at the Seventh Street end of the dining room are very popular and provide guests with a sense of intimacy. 
    
     
    
    The centerpiece of the space is the unique red gum grill, with the sights, scents and sounds of the grill adding to the guest experience. 
    
     
    
    The grill is not just a slice of entertainment, it is central to the wonderful and unique flavour of our steaks. Freshly fired daily, the grill uses hand-made coal derived from dropped red gum and mallee roots lifted by farmers during clearing. The coals add a subtle flavour to the meat during cooking that cannot be replicated with traditional gas or electrical grills. 
    
     
    
    So where are the tapas you ask? Well, we're not really Spanish at all, the name has simply been retained for historical authenticity. The original Spanish Grill was a prominent feature of the old Grand Hotel. It had keen local patronage and was closed in 1989. 
    
     
    
    The new Spanish Grill has been created to remember the past, and although there is really nothing Spanish about it, the name is to evoke nostalgia, and to please former patrons. The current proprietors are delighted to carry on this Mildura tradition.

But there's much more to see than great views - the main drawcard of The Nobbies is the chance to view Australia's largest colony of fur seals, located 1km offshore. Up to 16,000 seals gather at Seal Rocks, with the number peaking during breeding season from October to December. Watch the seals sunning themselves on the rocks, feeding their young, wrestling, or flopping into the cool water. From the boardwalks at The Nobbies you can watch their transformation from ungainly land creatures to swift, sleek marine dwellers twisting and rolling in the clear waters. For a closer look, visit the new Nobbies Centre which has just opened on the headland. The centre features state-of-the-art animal viewing technology, via a camera positioned on Seal Rocks that can be steered by visitors to zoom in on their favourite seal. Also onsite are educational displays about marine life, a caf\xC3\xA9 and upstairs function centre."

    As well as its conservation importance the reserve represents a unique passive recreational and educational asset in the greater metropolitan area of Melbourne.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * The reserve is ideal for recreation activities such as nature study, photography and walking
     
    * Walk to Trig Point for expansive views of the reserve, Port Phillip Bay and the Dandenongs. A network of tracks allows visitors to walk to most features of the reserve
     
     
    Heritage 
     
     
    Very little is known of Aboriginal activity in the area other than the use of the springs as a source of fresh water by the Bunurong people. In the 1920's it was planned to plant the whole area between Ballarto Road, Dandenong Road, McClelland Drive and Skye Road with pine trees. Only about 120ha was planted, though in the 1950's some of the remaining land was set aside for housing. 
     
     
    A proposal in the 1970's to sandmine the remaining bushland met with community uproar and the Eureka flag was raised on Trig Point (the site from which the Frankston area was originally surveyed) and the area claimed for the people of Frankston. Community action also helped prevent the area being subdivided in 1989 and the Flora and Fauna Reserve is now zoned as public open space.
     
     
    Looking after the park
    
     
    * Take your rubbish with you
     
    * Keep to the formed walking tracks
     
    * Dog regulations apply. In areas where dogs are permitted they must be on a leash at all times
     
    * Firearms are not permitted in the reserve
     
    * All native plants and animals are protected
     
    * Leave the reserve as you find it

    You are always welcome to drop in and browse the range of art, craft and other tempting trinkets that are on offer, or enquire about their luxury B&B accommodation, The Parrots' Nest Mountain Hideaway.  For sumptuous breakfasts, or lavish lunches that will impress you, your friends and guests, visit the Red Parrot Cafe in magnificently beautiful Noojee.  There is a cosy log fire and the cafe is warm and inviting during those chilly winter days and there is also outdoor dining available for the warmer months.

    Little over an hour from Melbourne in the southern part of the Heathcote Wine region in Central Victoria, The Redesdale is a wonderful proponent of slow food. This unique journey into local produce and winemaking will reward every visitor.
     
     
    The Redesdale has a simple philosophy. Use the best local and organic produce to create seasonal food properly. From local wild rabbit, hare and goats to fresh water fish and yabbies, our food miles are reduced, providing a genuine taste of what this region has to offer. Organic vegetables, nuts and fruit travel even shorter distances while hand-made pasta, bread, biscuits, ice cream and yoghurt are churned out of the kitchen regularly

- :description: "Dining on the deck of the Stokehouse on a balmy summer's evening is perhaps the best possible entr\xC3\xA9e to Melbourne's wonderfully relaxed yet supremely sophisticated fine dining scene. Set right on St Kilda beach with palm trees framing the view, this restaurant housed in a beautifully restored 1920s beach shack is a culinary and social landmark.\n \n \n\
    Stokehouse has it all - inventive contemporary food that draws on the influences of Asia, the Middle East and Europe, a great wine list, expert staff, a lively and buoyant atmosphere and killer views. During winter the open fireplace keeps everyone cosy while the rest of the year diners battle for those precious outdoor tables where the fashionable crowd aim to be seen.\n \n \n\
    In true Aussie style there's an informal bistro downstairs that spills customers out onto the beach, where they chat and flirt, cold beers or chardonnays in hand."

    The Timboon Railway Shed Distillery is just 15 minutes from The Great Ocean Road, The 12 Apostles and Port Campbell. 
    
     
    
    The building has been sensitively restored to achieve both a modern and rustic ambience. A 600lt copper pot still bubbles away in the corner distilling fine Single Malt Whisky, Vodka, Schnapps and other classic spirits. Visitors are most welcome to sample some of the spirits, talk to the Distiller, and learn about the art of distilling and of the local illicit distilling history.  
    
     
    
    The Shed also serves as the central hub for local produce in the area. Over 13 local producers within a 20 km radius supply the shed with their goods. Smoked Eel, honey, ice cream, strawberries, ales and wines, cheese and Belgian chocolates are just some of the products available. The menu in the 70 seat restaurant reflects the abundance of local produce too. 
    
     
    
    Ample parking for cars and coaches, excellent clean toilet facilities are provided along with easy ramped wheelchair access. A rewarding visit.

    This is a real find for those who like to get away from it all. Hidden amongst the beautiful, heavily-forested hills and deep valleys of the Gippsland high country south of Traralgon, this isolated vineyard is a gem. The cellar door is a casual affair, friendly and unpretentious, and a couple of smart little cottages offer comfortable accommodation among the vines and trees. Nature is right on the doorstep at this cool-climate vineyard. Ralph Kyte-Powell

    Located seven kilometres east of Port Campbell, the Twelve Apostles Marine National Park is Victoria's second largest Marine National Park and covers 7,500 hectares along approximately 17 kilometres of coastline. The park extends out from the renowned Twelve Apostles and includes some of Victoria's most spectacular underwater scenery. There are rich intertidal and subtidal invertebrate communities, dramatic underwater arches, canyons, fissures, gutters and deep sloping reefs. Although the Marine National Park itself is relatively inaccessible from the shore because of the high cliffs and powerful sea conditions, the park includes the Twelve Apostles rock formations, and is the third most visited natural site in Australia.
     
     
    The wild and powerful Southern Ocean that sculpts the area's limestone landscape also shrouds a remarkable seascape beneath the waves; a submarine labyrinth of towering canyons, caves, arches and walls. These natural features are festooned with colourful seaweed and sponge 'gardens', resident schools of reef fish, such as sweep, gliding above and the occasional visit by an Australian Fur Seal.
     
     
    Breeding colonies of seabirds regularly inhabit the rock stacks and islands within the park and the adjacent coastline has sites of significance for flora and fauna. There are also sites of geological and geomorphological significance including karst (ie cave) topography.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Its diversity of wildflowers and the abundance of its bird life make it a favourite destination for naturalists.
     
     
    The park, which was proclaimed in January 1986, encompasses the fine scenery of the Tyers Gorge where the Tyers River winds between steep forested slopes. Outcrops of limestone and conglomerate are of considerable geological interest. The limestone contains both plant and animal fossils.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Scenic drives, bushwalks, picnicking, swimming, camping, fishing and nature study are some of the more popular activities at Tyers Park
     
    * Spring (the main wildflower season) and autumn are popular times to visit but the park has plenty to offer throughout the year
     
    * A walking track has been constructed along the Tyers River running from the Moondarra Reservoir south through the park. To walk the full length of the track takes about 5 hours
     
    * Peterson's Lookout is a crag of conglomerate rock which overlooks the Tyers Gorge and provides fine views of the Tyers River and the gorge, as well as the Latrobe Valley
     
     
    Motel accommodation and caravan parks with on-site facilities are available in nearby Rawson and Erica. Eat-in and take-away meals are available in both towns
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    Tyers Park encompasses the Tyers Gorge location of the original weir supplying water to the growing towns of Tyers and Traralgon.
     
     
    The park is also home to a regionally important Lime Kiln and associated quarry which supplied lime and building materials to various locations across central and south Gippsland.
     
     
    Since the early 1970's, Peterson's Lookout has been a popular point of interest to the Latrobe Valley Field Naturalists.
     
     
    Precautions
     
     
    A number of unsurfaced tracks in the park are suitable for 4-wheel drive vehicles only. Please respect the locked gates as indicated. To avoid getting lost, please keep to marked tracks.

    The unmistakable nostalgic sound of a steam locomotive s whistle can be heard in the distance on any Wednesday or Sunday as you stroll along the main streets of Castlemaine or Maldon.
     
     
    The sounds of the train whistle is part of the historic atmosphere that lingers as part of the living heritage in these old goldfields towns.
     
     
    The steam trains that operate from the historic Maldon and Castlemaine Stations have a certain magic that captures the imagination of young and old.
     
     
    The dedicated members of Victorian Goldfields Railway have ensured that the magic of the steam era lives on in central Victoria: reviving all the sights, sounds and activities of a by   gone era.
     
     
    The strength of the experience with Victorian Goldfields Railway is based on its authenticity. The project is a living, working piece of history, which still rekindles memories of the steam days for many older folk and which fascinates those who cannot recall the days when steam ruled the rails across Victoria.
     
     
    As well as the regular steam train journeys, Victorian Goldfields Railway has introduced numerous other activities which add to the experience.
     
     
    Individuals can take a ride on the locomotive, with the driver and fireman, for a modest extra charge on the normal fare. The footplate experience is greatly enjoyed by those who choose to try it.
     
     
    Another exceptional steamy thing to do is to arrange a Driver Experience Day. This includes a full day of instruction, culminating in the participant actually driving the locomotive   under the watchful eye of the instructor of course.
     
     
    For more information about the great steam train experience linking Castlemaine & Maldon phone 54706658 or visit the website.

    Vines of Red Hill, a special sense of place. 
    
     
    
    Vines of Red Hill is one of those beautiful country estates that reveals itself a little at a time. Invisible from Red Hill road, it sits down from the brow of the hill, shaded by ancient Angophora trees; it is reached by a path that winds its way through lavishly planted gardens. 
    
     
    
    The natural amphitheatre of the land shelters the Vines of Red Hill in its own uniquely intimate environment. The restaurant and cellar door are housed in a contemporary Mediterranean inspired building that looks out over 20 acres of gently sloping vineyards and pasture land. 
    
     
    
    The restaurant's philosophy is all about the Mornington Peninsula's very essence, captured in food and wine. The diversity of local produce is reflected by daily created menus that boast a sense of adventure, experience and skill. The Vines has an air of contemporary spaciousness with an elegant simplicity that brings a true regional flavour to your table. 
    
     
    
    Owner and Chef James Redfern's firm and passionate belief that regions need to retain and develop their special and unique identity drives his cuisine at Vines of Red Hill. 
    
     
    
    Natural approaches with traditional techniques are used to produce 100per cent estate grown Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Gewurztraminer. These are available for tasting and for purchasing exclusively in the tower tasting room or in the restaurant. 
    
     
    
    Vines of Red Hill are open every day for lunch and wine tasting, and for dinner on Friday and Saturdays with reduced trading during the winter.
     
     
    The restaurant also specialises in Weddings and corporate or special event.

    Take a step back in time as you climb aboard our award winning 1940s Tiger Moths. These aircrafts were used to train combat pilots in WWII.
     
     
    You will look the part wearing our leather flying helmet, goggles, gloves and flying jacket as you feel the wind in your face and experience the freedom of open cockpit flying.
     
     
    First flying in 1931, this rugged aeroplane has forged a reputation for reliability and safety. The aircraft can perform a wide range of aerobatic manoeuvres such as spins, loops and barrel rolls.
     
     
    You will never know the sheer joy of flying until you take a flight in the legendary Tiger Moth. Bring a friend along and try a formation flight.
     
     
    For the thrill seekers take a ride in the awesome Yak 52 Russian aerobatic aircraft. The ultimate 3D rollercoaster ride without the theme park queues! Carve up the sky with high speed loops and rolls.
     
     
    Get the adrenalin pumping as you experience an inverted spin, if you dare. Try some aerobatics yourself, even if you can't fly. The Yak is equally at home completing gentle turns and dives with the canopy open for a more leisurely flight.
     
     
    We operate from historic Point Cook Airfield which is the oldest continuously operating military air base in the world. It is also home for the RAAF Museum. We fly 7 days a week and bookings are essential. Gift vouchers are available.

    Vue de monde chef Shannon Bennett's philosophy is to offer a dining experience that cannot be produced at home. Dedicated to the whole dining experience, from the sourcing of rare ingredients and an uncompromising approach to classical technique, Vue de monde embodies the very best in restaurant service right down to the crockery, cutlery and glassware.
     
     
    Inspired by recipes dating back hundreds of years, the menu at Vue de monde has evolved to encompass more modern interpretations. Classic French ingredients such as Strasbourg Foie Gras, black Perigord truffles and caviar are presented along side hand-sourced local produce.
     
     
    The wine list focuses on the great European vineyards, offering a range of both iconic and lesser-known boutique producers. A selection of Australian wines adds character and depth to the list.

    Ride with Walhalla Goldfields Railway through the spectacular Stringers Creek Gorge.
     
     
    As you begin your journey and depart the Walhalla Heritage Precinct, you will travel through the station yard which lies between Stringers Creek and the cliff-face that underpins the Brunton's Bridge Road.
     
     
    After you leave the engine and carriage sheds behind the first kilometre and a half is almost entirely built over six large trestle bridges that criss-cross Stringers Creek Gorge in an effort to find anchorage for each bridge abutment.
     
     
    As the train winds it's way down hill you will pass through Happy Creek to begin the second half of your journey.
     
     
    The train journey follows Stringers Creek to where it joins the Thomson River; then we travel across the historic and spectacular Thomson River  Bridge to arrive at Thomson Station where you will have time to explore the area before returning to Walhalla.
     
     
    In spring and summer wild flowers are prevalent throughout the gorge.
     
     
    Catch the breathtaking beauty of the autumn trees in April when they appear to light up sections of the valley.
     
     
    Then in the winter Stringers Creek comes to life with increased water flows which spill over the attractive waterfall.
     
     
    During the January school holiday period, trains operate on a daily basis - check the timetable for details

    Walhalla, a rich gold producer for 50 years, lives on as a remote and picturesque mountain township. It is hard to imagine a more difficult site for a town than the steep, narrow valley of Stringers Creek as it winds down through the dense forests of the Baws Baws. Yet in its heyday, between 1880 and 1895, more than 4000 people lived there.
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    Gold was found in Stringers Creek in 1863 and by 1866 numerous mines within the valley were opened. The great Long Tunnel Company, to which the prosperity of Walhalla owed its existence, became the greatest single producer of gold in Victoria. It closed in 1913. Walhalla once supported 15 hotels, 40 shops, two breweries, four churches, a school, jail and its own newspaper. Timber getters denuded the hillsides in supplying mining companies with 34 000 tons of timber a year.
     
     
    The permanent population of Walhalla today is fewer than 20, although there are many more temporary residents and visitors on holidays and weekends.
     
     
    The narrow-guage railway arrived from Moe in 1910 only in time to see the town die. The two major mines closed in 1911 and 1913 and the trains which were to have brought posperity were used to cart away Walhalla's buildings. By 1920 there were only 250 people left. The railway closed in 1944 but is being rebuilt as a tourist railway.
     
     
    There are many things to see and do in Walhalla, for more information visit the website above.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.

    Extending for 25 kilometres north of the town of Glenrowan in north-east Victoria, is a steep scarped range known locally as the Warbys. The combination of excellent viewing points along the ridge, pleasant picnic spots and outstanding variety of birdlife and wildflowers provides visitors with a memorable experience.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
     
    * Management tracks and the open grassy understorey are ideal for easy walking. Make sure to bring water to the park in summer and carry it on walks
     
    * Bushwalkers wishing to camp away from the roads and tracks are required to make arrangements with the ranger before their trip
     
    * The views from Ryan's Lookout are exceptional, especially in winter. To get an overall appreciation of the varying Warby landscape, motorists can take a short round trip starting at Ryan's Lookout and going along Gerrett Road before linking up with Adam's Track and the Thoona Road
     
    * The one kilometre Pine Gully Nature Walk, starting near the picnic area beside the Wangaratta-Thoona Road, 4.5 kilometres west of Ryan's Lookout, provides a good introduction to the plants and animals of the Warbys. The walk is reasonably strenuous and takes and hour to complete suitable footwear is essential
     
    * At Wenhams camp the Friends of Warby Ranges have constructed a 4km walking track. There is an information brochure box at each end of the track. This track connects to another leading to the Kwat Kwat lookout which gives a magnificent view of Wangaratta and the snow capped mountains of Mount Buffalo, Falls Creek and Mount Bogong
     
    * Other lookouts are the Pangarang lookout near Pine Gully Picnic Area and Mt Glenrowan Lookout, at the highest point of the Warbys at an elevation of 513 metres. Mt Glenrowan Lookout is accessed from Tamnick Gap Road.

    Dotted with relics of the gold mining era, the hills around Warrandyte have a distinctive bluish-green hue, typical of the foliage of Red Box, a common eucalypt of the area. The Yarra links a number of areas which together form Warrandyte State Park, only 24 kilometres from Melbourne by road. The 620 hectare park's treasures include spring wildflowers, native wildlife and the site of Victoria's first gold discovery in 1851.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
     
    * The clear light and peace and silence of the bush have always been a source of inspiration to artists, writers and people who wish to contemplate nature.
     
    * Picnicking, bushwalking, swimming, bird-watching, fishing, exploring forgotten goldfields, nature walks and photography are popular.
     
    * So is canoeing on the Yarra River, but sufficient time must be allowed for this activity - the journey by canoe from the canoe access ramp at Wittons Reserve (Mount Lofty) to Jumping Creek Reserve is about six hours.
     
    * Horse riding is permitted along designated trails, and gold panning is allowed in Andersons Creek.
     
    * Abseiling and rock climbing are permitted at Whipstick Gully Quarry by arrangement with the senior ranger.
     
    * At Pound Bend it is possible to see the tunnel which was dug to divert the river and enable the exposed river bed to be dredged for gold.
     
     
    Warrandyte State Park Mine Safety Works - Parks Victoria in its management of the Warrandyte State Park encompasses numerous disused mines, a legacy of the gold mining era. Recent assessments of the safety of these mines have confirmed that the mines do not conform to current safety requirements for visitor access. To prevent risk to visitors, Parks Victoria will be implementing programmed safety works at the following mines within Warrandyte State Park; Victory, Johnson's, Monument, Upper Monument and Geraghty's.

    Heritage
     
     
    In 1915 the Hawthorn Tramways Trust purchased the then rural land from Mrs Eliza Welch for (Pound)9,000 on the condition that it was to be used as a public park. It was not until the late 1920s and early 1930's that extensive planning and development commenced with the construction of the Chalet in 1928, curator's cottage in 1932 and most of the sporting facilities over the next few years.
     
     
    The Field Naturalists Club of Victoria and the Wattle League were influential in the planting of 12,000 wattles, natives and ornamental trees between 1926 and 1928.
     
     
    Looking after the park
     
     
    Please make sure your dog is on a lead and leave your horses and trail bikes at home. The park policy is 'Carry In, Carry Out', so please take your rubbish home. Large groups should contact the park prior to their event.

    Geological features, spectacular views, native flora and fauna and opportunities for bushwalking and rock climbing are the attractions of the 443 hectare Werribee Gorge State Park, about 65 km west of Melbourne.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
     
    * The Bacchus Marsh district acquired world-wide fame last century as one of the earliest known occurrences of ancient glacial deposits and Werribee Gorge State Park is still a place where many interesting geological features can be seen. These point to a remarkably varied geological history.
     
    * A variety of walking experiences is available in the park. A popular walk follows the Werribee River from Meikles Point picnic area. This walk gives visitors an impressive view of both the river and the cliff faces of the gorge. It leads to popular swimming holes, historic sites and other park features. The track is difficult in places and requires a reasonable degree of fitness.
     
    * A longer day walk can be made by completing the Circuit Walk up the hill from Meikles Point Picnic Area and returning along the River Walk. Tracks are generally well marked but the degree of difficulty, length and time required for completion are not currently shown.
     
     
    Precautions
    
     
    * Be aware that after heavy rain the river can rise suddenly.

    Heritage
     
     
    Prior to European settlement, the area was originally part of the Wurundjeri tribe territory. The area which is now Westerfolds Park was purchased from the Crown in 1846 and had an unremarkable history until the Turner family bought the property in the early 1930's and built the Manor in 1936.
     
     
    By the 1950's the growing population had pushed most of the large-scale farmers and orchardists out of the surrounding area, but residential and industrial development did not occur in the river valley, mainly because of the threat of flooding. Westerfolds was salvaged from suburban development and added to the Yarra Valley Parklands in 1977.
     
     
    In 1978, due to growing community interest in the environment and a demand for areas of open space to pursue passive recreation, Melbourne Parks and Waterways (later Parks Victoria) began to manage and develop the land into Westerfolds Park.

    Heritage
     
     
    The area was originally part of the saltmarsh that extended north from the Yarra up the Maribyrnong River to the present site of Fiemington Racecourse. Sand mining commenced in the 1930's and continued for at least a decade. Part of the excavated land was filled with water to form the southern saltwater lake. The remainder of the park was used as a rubbish tip, which operated for 23 years. During World War II an aircraft factory and airfield occupied the site.
     
     
    Looking after the park
    
         
    * All native animals and vegetation are protected and are not to be removed from Westgate Park
         
    * Please take all rubbish home with you
         
    * Dogs are permitted in the park, but must be kept on a leash at all times
         
    * Leave the park as you find it

    Warrnambool is known as Victoria's southern right whale nursery. Most years between June and September, female southern right whales return to the waters of Logans Beach near Warrnambool to calve. The whales often swim within 100 metres of the shore and can be viewed from a specially constructed platform in the sand dunes or from the beach. In summer southern right whales live in the sub-Antarctic. In winter they migrate to warmer waters around the southern areas of Australia. The females migrate to the 'nursery' areas close to the shore to bear their calves, while the males, yearlings and young adults remain further out to sea. The females generally stay in the nursery for many weeks, allowing the calves to feed and gather strength for their journey back to the sub-Antarctic waters.
    The southern right whale can be recognised by its smooth, black back and lack of a dorsal fin. On the head of each southern right whale are a number of crusty outgrowths called callosities, markings that differ from whale to whale. Irregular white patches sometimes found on the whale's belly distinguish these animals from other species. Whales are protected in Australian waters by Federal and State laws.

    Whinstone Estate offers a family friendly and informal setting with owners Ken and Leon Wood on hand to discuss the wines and viticulture. 
    
     
    
    Wander through the property s extensive gardens, enjoy the magnificent rural view and picnic by the dam. 
    
     
    
    Specialising in cool climate wines produced with minimum chemical use from a single vineyard, Whinstone aims to produce wines which are elegant, fruit driven and affordable. 
    
     
    
    Whinstone Estate was established in 1994. Since that time the vineyard has developed a reputation for growing exceptionally fine fruit which has been sold to several of the larger premium winemakers on the Mornington Peninsula. At the same time grapes were put aside to make wines under the Whinstone label. Varieties grown at Whinstone Estate are Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadet/Melon. These wines became available under the Whinstone label late in 2003. Several vintages have been cellared to allow the wines to develop. 
    
     
    
    Whinstone Estate's cellar door is now open every weekend and on public holidays (except Christmas Day and Good Friday) from 11am to 5pm for free tastings of the Whinstone Estate range including latest releases. Vertical tastings can be arranged. The Cellar Door is open every day through January. 
    
     
    
    The name of the vineyard was derived from a geological name for the rocks that appeared when the vineyard was being prepared for planting. Situated on the slopes of a beautiful valley on the Mornington peninsula the vineyard enjoys a Northwest aspect

    Making its home in the picturesque little fishing village of Port Albert, 'wildfish' is Gippsland s newest waterfront restaurant. With a simple philosophy of producing the freshest local seafood caught by local fishermen 'wildfish' is much welcomed in the food and wine circles of Gippsland. Occupying the site of the old fishermen s co-op, diners are likely to see the fresh seafood on the menu being unloaded from the fishing boats on the wharf at the front of the restaurant.  
     
     
    Owner Michael Hobson, himself a fifth generation fisherman knows his seafood and employs a full time fish monger so every step from the boat to the plate is controlled within the 'wildfish' philosophy.  Michael whose family have lived in Port Albert since 1846 gave away fishing and pursued a career in the international super yachting industry, working for identities such as Sir Richard Branson and Billy Connelly before returning to Port Albert to see his seafood vision become a reality.
     
     
    Port Albert is such a special place, a rich maritime history, beautiful natural scenery and surrounded by some of the countries best National Parks. A picturesque two and a half hour drive from Melbourne and you're already relaxed. Step into wildfish and truly unwind. You can choose from a cocktail or fantastic local wines that you can enjoy at the beautiful handcrafted bar or sink into the cosy lounge before your meal. There is nothing better on a beautiful day than dining on fresh seafood on the deck which is literally on the water.
     
     
    The service is warm and friendly, the food is exceptional and the surroundings amazing.

These sculptures are an expression of Rickett's philosophy - that all people need to act as custodians of the natural environment in the same way as Aborigines, the inspiration for much of his work.
         
    * Stroll through the gardens and explore the 92 ceramic sculptures of people and animals which merge with the natural surroundings.
         
    * Enjoy the audio-visual display featuring William Ricketts where visitors can see for themselves the vision and passion that live in his art.
    
     
     
    Heritage 
    
     
    
    In the 1930s William Rickets bought a four-acre bush block on Mount Dandenong and called it Potter's Sanctuary. Word spread about the extraordinary sculptures that began to adorn the property. In time, the Victorian Government heard about his work and, in the early 1960s, the land and adjoining blocks were bought for the people. William Ricketts lived on at the Sanctuary into his nineties and continued to create his sculptures until his death in 1993.

    Willow Creek Vineyard is located in Merricks North on Victoria's beautiful Mornington Peninsula. The vineyard was established in 1988 after five Melbourne families decided to pursue their dream of owning a vineyard.
     
     
    The property is home to Salix Restaurant & Bistro which makes it the perfect place to experience single site, cool climate wines alongside sensational, local produce driven food. Salix is open everyday for lunch and Friday and Saturday nights for dinner. 
    
     
    
    Willow Creek Vineyard wines aim to maximise the potential of twenty-year-old vines to express our unique site terroir using regional flagship varieties chardonnay and pinot noir. Small plantings of pinot gris and sauvignon blanc have been added in recent years. Our Cellar Door is open everyday for tastings from 10am - 5pm. 
    
     
    
    Viticulturist RobbieO'Leary has been looking after Willow Creek's vines for almost 20 vintages. His knowledge of the site is unmatched. The new partnership with winemaker Geraldine McFaul combines Robbie's intimate understanding of the site with a winemaking approach focusing on minimal intervention. This duo heralds an exciting new era for Willow Creek Vineyard and a chance to reveal the true character of the site's terroir.
     
     
    Willow Creek really came onto the market with a bang in the early 90s and the wines continue to impress, as do the cellar door facilities and the restaurant. Food served in the restaurant is created to complement the fine wines and the views. Stuart Gregor

- :description: One of the most popular destinations in Victoria, Wilsons Promontory National Park sits at the southernmost tip of the Australian mainland, offering visitors stunning scenery and wildlife. The 50,000 hectare national park features magnificent and secluded beaches, cool fern gullies, great views, spectacular rock formations and an abundance of wildlife. From the moment you enter the park, the native wildlife is never far away. See kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, emus, dazzling crimson rosellas and wedge-tailed eagles or try your luck at spotting one of the more than 40 rare or threatened species, including the long-nosed potoroo, eastern pygmy-possum, orange-bellied parrot and New Holland mouse. There are plenty of scenic drives at the Prom, but the best way to enjoy the landscape is on one of the many walking trails throughout the peninsula. Walkers will find more than 30 walks over 130 kilometres of tracks to choose from, with most leading to a range of secluded beaches, coves and lookouts. The walk to the summit of Mt Oberon provides unsurpassed views of the Prom and its rugged coastline. Other short walks take you to Squeaky Beach, Picnic Bay and Whisky Bay, while longer walks can be made to Cotters Beach and Vereker Lookout. Other popular activities at the Prom include swimming, diving and fishing. Tidal River, 30 kilometres from the park entrance, has most facilities, including a Visitor Centre and general store.

    Wilsons Promontory Marine National Park extends along 70 kilometres of mainland coastline and covers 15,550 hectares, making it the largest of our Marine National Parks. It is located around the southern tip of the Wilsons Promontory National Park, incorporating the existing Wilsons Promontory Marine Reserve. Most of the terrestrial areas of Wilsons Promontory have been reserved since 1905, and its importance for nature conservation is widely appreciated.
     
     
    Wilsons Promontory Marine National Park provides spectacular underwater scenery with granite cliffs plunging below the surface. Huge granite boulders and pinnacles rise from the sparkling white or yellow sand, topped by carpets of multi-coloured seaweed. Fish busily move in and around these forests, including the unusually named Bastard Trumpeter, Saddled Wrasse and Old Wife. There are also deep reefs covered in sponges, ascidians, sea whips and abundant fish. The park also includes islands that are home to penguins and seabirds and some that are used as breeding grounds for Australian Fur Seals.
     
     
    Wilsons Promontory is the northernmost exposed link in a chain of granite mountains that continues across Bass Strait and onto eastern Tasmania. Due the different type of rock found here and its position at the boundary of the influence two major ocean currents, Wilsons Promontory Marine National Park provides for long term conservation of a distinct bioregion of Victoria's coastline.
     
     
    A wide range of facilities are located at Tidal River including unpowered campsites, cabins, toilets, showers, a visitor centre and a shop. Remote campsites are also located throughout the National Park. Early booking for campsites is advised due to the popularity of the area for camping.

    Woodlands Historic Park gives visitors a fascinating glimpse of the landscape seen by settlers in the 1840s. First established as a public park in 1980, Woodlands Historic Park now totals over 700 ha. It contains significant cultural and natural values which have endured many of the changes resulting from Melbourne's urban spread.
     
     
    Things to see and do
    
         
    * Visit Woodlands Homestead. Hosts will provide interesting accounts of its many owners over the years.
         
    * Enjoy a picnic among the magnificent River Red Gum trees at the Somerton Road picnic area.
         
    * Explore the 1.5 km Moonee Ponds Creek Nature Walk.
         
    * Wander through the fenced 'Back Paddock' and see kangaroos, birds and other wildlife.
         
    * Walk up Gellibrand Hill (204 m). Explore the granite boulders and enjoy panoramic views.
         
    * Find out more about guided walks, spotlight strolls and more.
         
    * Sign up with the Friends of Woodlands Historic Park Inc. and assist our rangers on a variety of projects.
         
    * Jog or ride a bike or horse along the tracks.
         
    * View kangaroos in their natural surroundings.
    
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    Scarred trees and surface tool scatters are evidence of the Woiworung people, who lived in the area before Europeans arrived. The descendants of the Woiworung still retain a close identity with the land around Melbourne.
     
     
    The historic Woodlands Homestead complex is important because it is a rare example of an early prefabricated building and for its association with the pioneering families of the Port Phillip District. Magnolias at the Homestead are the oldest recorded garden plants in Victoria. Woodlands Homestead and its outbuildings and gardens were extensively restored in 1983 and 1984 under Federal, State and Local Government programs.

The central feature of this huge, 356,800 ha park, is a chain of lake beds connected by Outlet Creek, the northern extension of the Wimmera River. The lakes only fill when the Wimmera River over-supplies Lake Hindmarsh to the south of Lake Albacutya. When it rains the semi-arid landscape is transformed by tiny desert plants that sprout from long-dormant seeds, carpeting the ground with clusters of flowers.
     
     
    Things to Do
    
         
    * The Eastern Lookout Nature Drive is highly recommended as a good introduction to the park.
         
    * There are a number of self-guided walks that provide a closer look at the plant and animal life of Wyperfeld. Leaflets are available at the start of the tracks.
         
    * The Eastern Lookout and entrance roads, and the Outlet Creek track are good for cycling. Other tracks are too sandy.
    
     
     
    Facilities
    
         
    * The Information Centre near the main camping ground has displays and information about the park.
         
    * The large wooded picnic and camping area in the south of the park caters for most park visitors. Facilities include a picnic shelter, tables, fireplaces, toilets, and water for handwashing. Be self-sufficient with drinking water. Carry it in and/or know how to make untreated water safe for drinking.
         
    * General supplies and accommodation are available in Yaapeet, Hopetoun and Rainbow.

    Heritage
     
     
    The reservoir was Melbourne's first and has supplied the city with water since 1857. It was the plan of James Blackburn, a civil engineer who unfortunately died before ever seeing his dream developed. The historic bluestone valve house and stone water channel are reminders of the reservoir's history.

    Yaringa Marine National Park covers 980 ha between the mainland and Quail Island Nature Conservation Reserve, about 9 km south-west of Tooradin. The area comprises saltmarsh, mangroves, sheltered intertidal mudflats, subtidal soft sediments and tidal channels. Yaringa Marine National Park is quite isolated and only directly accessible by boat or from the township of Yaringa on the western shore of Western Port.
     
     
    Vegetation 
    
     
    
    White Mangrove (Avicennia marina) 
    
    The most developed and extensive Victorian mangrove populations occur in Westernport Bay. White mangroves, Avicennia marina subsp. Australasica, are the only mangroves that grow in Victoria and also grow in most other states except Tasmania. They are often quite stunted in size in Victoria compared with their tropical relatives and many appear as growing as trees or shrubs, up to 2.4 metre tall rather than true trees.

    Heritage
    
     
     
    The Yarra Flats area was originally inhabited by members of the Wurundjeri tribe of Aboriginals. The area is still significant to the existing descendants of the Wurundjeri.
     
     
    During the 1830's some of the earliest land sales in Melbourne originated at Yarra Flats.
     
     
    In the 1860's droughts and floods forced many farmers and most of the intensive agricultural practices off the land. It was during this time that dairy farmers established themselves.
     
     
    During the flourishing years of the 1880's-90's large estates were built and the Heidelberg School of Art enjoyed the landscapes. The likes of Condon, McCubbin and Streeton captured these memories on canvas. They are now recognised as National Treasures.
     
     
    At the turn of the century farms were being gradually replaced by grand houses such as those of the Glenard Estate designed by Walter Burley Griffin.
     
     
    The last dairy farmers were the Flemming brothers who sold their land in the 1970's. The Park was officially opened to the public in 1984.

    A Melbourne icon, the river is the focus for numerous spectacular events including the famous Moomba festival, rowing regattas, the Melbourne Festival and Dragon Boat Festivals.
     
     
    Heritage
     
     
    The Yarra River was very important to Aboriginal people, and its name is thought to derive from Aboriginal words meaning ever flowing. In 1803, Charles Grimes, Acting Surveyor General of New South Wales, led the first party of Europeans up the Yarra River.
     
     
    The river was instrumental in the establishment of Melbourne beside its banks in 1835. It provided shelter for the first ships and drinking water for the first inhabitants; it drained the neighbouring land; it was a ready made sewer; and it gave the early industries the large volumes of water necessary in their processes. After a steady deterioration in water quality during the 19th century, measures were undertaken more recently to clean up the river.
     
     
    Over the years, the mouth of the river has been completely transformed by realignment, widening and deepening in order to create a large modern port.
     
     
    Things to do
    
     
    * The Yarra River offers a multitude of picturesque settings. The banks of the river have a number of barbecue and picnic facilities, fishing platforms and jettys.
     
    * In addition, there are trails and paths which cater for cyclists, walkers and joggers.

    Few Yarra Valley wineries are as well located as this new operation in the valley's southern hills. It's a beautiful location, and neighbours include some big names known for benchmark wine quality. YarraLoch is run with an obsessive eye which augurs well for the future.  Vineyard plots as far afield as Kangaroo Ground and the old quality wine region of Whittlesea have been chosen for their suitability for paritcular grapes, and wines made here include regional oddities like Arneis and Viognier, as well as better known varieties. A winery to watch.

    Heritage
    
     
     
    Yarrambat Park was once frequented by the local aboriginal people - the Wurundjeri. The word Yarrambat means 'High Hill'.
     
     
    In the 1840's Tancks Corner (Yarrambat) was settled by squatters who grazed cattle and sheep.
     
     
    Gold mining began in the Plenty area in the 1850's. However it was not the discovery of gold that was important to the area but the increased need for meat and agricultural produce.

    The granite peaks of the You Yangs rise dramatically in the Werribee lava plains. Although only 352 m in height, they dominate the landscape and are clearly identifiable from Melbourne and beyond.
     
     
    Things to Do 
    
     
    
    Spring and summer are the best times to visit.
    
         
    * Enjoy a picnic or barbecue.
         
    * Walk to Flinders Peak, the highest point in the You Yangs. On a clear day you can see Mount Macedon, the Brisbane Ranges, Geelong, Corio Bay and the tall buildings of Melbourne.
         
    * See the Aboriginal rock wells on Big Rock.
         
    * Try to identify some of the 200 or more birds in the area.
         
    * Take the Great Circle Drive which takes you to many features around the park.
         
    * Four main walks cover the park and all are well signposted.
         
    * Camping is not permitted within the park.
    
     
     
    Heritage 
    
     
    
    The name 'You Yang' comes from the Aboriginal words 'Wurdi Youang' or 'Ude Youang' meaning 'big mountain in the middle of a plain'. Aboriginal people enlarged natural hollows in the rocks to form wells that held water even in dry seasons.
     
     
    Explorer Matthew Flinders was the first European to visit the You Yangs. On 1 May 1802 he and three of his men climbed to the highest point. He named it 'Station Peak' but this was later changed to Flinders Peak in his honour.
     
     
    For the latest information on track closures and park access, please see the Parks Victoria website. Be bushfire smart. Follow the Parks Victoria checklist before travelling.
